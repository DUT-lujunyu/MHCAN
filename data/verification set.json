Adsorption and competitive sorption of imidacloprid on clay minerals and humic acids (HA) were determined using the batch equilibration method. The sorption coefficient of imidacloprid on humic acids was significantly higher than that on Ca-clay minerals, indicating that soil organic matter content was a more important property in influencing the adsorption of imidacloprid. Competitive sorption was investigated between imidacloprid and its main metabolite imidacloprid-urea on HA and Ca-clay minerals. The results showed that the sorption capacity of imidacloprid on clay minerals and HA was reduced in the presence of the metabolite, implying that imidacloprid-urea could occupy or block adsorption sites of imidacloprid on soil, potentially affecting the fate, transport, and bioavailability of imidacloprid in the environment. The interactions between a Ca-clay or HA-clay mixture and adsorption of imidacloprid and imidacloprid-urea were studied using IR differential spectra on thin films made of the adsorbent.

Isolation of dimeric [NiII(SN4(tren)-RSdang)]2 (\u201cdang\u201d= dangling, uncoordinated thiolate supported by H bonds), using the less bulky [(tren)N4S]1- ligand, pointed to the need for gem-dimethyls adjacent to the sulfur to sterically prevent dimerization.

Hexadecane and palmitic acid were used as the base oil and typical fatty acid, respectively. A Cu-coated silicon wafer was prepared as the target substrate. The solvation structure formed by hexadecane molecules at the interface between the Cu substrate and the hexadecane was observed, and the layer pitch was found to be about 0.6 nm, which corresponds to the height of hexadecane molecules. This demonstrates that hexadecane molecules physically adsorbed onto the surface due to van der Waals forces with lying orientation because hexadecane is a nonpolar hydrocarbon. When hexadecane with palmitic acid was put on the Cu substrate instead of pure hexadecane, an adsorption layer of palmitic acid was observed at the interface. The layer pitch was about 2.5\u20132.8 nm, which matches the chain length of palmitic acid molecules well. This indicates that the original adsorption layer was monolayer or single bilayer in the local area. In addition, a cross-sectional image captured 1 h after observation started to reveal that the adsorbed additive layer gradually grew up to be thicker than about 20 nm due to an external stimulus, such as cantilever oscillation.

The assignment is assisted by theoretical calculations, which are based on the Orsay\u2013Trento density functional where the interaction between the helium droplet and the lithium atom is introduced by a pairwise additive approach.

Therefore, neither curvature effects, which would promote higher coverage, nor excluded volume effects, which would result in lower coverage, are present in these irregular surfaces. The high surface area of the bare electrodes exhibits a rapid surface decay in different liquid media that is hindered by alkanethiolate chemisorption. The presence of thiolate SAMs reduces markedly the mass transport surface diffusion of gold adatoms, hindering surface area decay and freezing the system in a metastable state for days.

An understanding of the structure of the whole protein is often vital to understanding its digestive behavior in animals and nutritive quality. Usually protein secondary structures include \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet. The percentages of these two structures in protein secondary structures may influence feed protein quality and digestive behavior. Feathers are widely available as a potential protein supplement. They are very high in protein (84%), but the digestibility of the protein is very low (5%). The objective of this study was to use synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy to reveal chemical features of feather protein secondary structure within amide I at ultraspatial resolution (pixel size = 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm), in comparison with other protein sources from easily digested feeds such as barley, oat, and wheat tissue at endosperm regions (without destruction of their inherent structure). This experiment was performed at beamline U2B of the Albert Einstein Center for Synchrotron Biosciences at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) in Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), U.S. Dept of Energy (NSLS-BNL, Upton, NY). The results showed that ultraspatially resolved chemical imaging of feed protein secondary structure in terms of \u03b2-sheet to \u03b1-helix peak height ratio by stepping in pixel-sized increments was obtained. Using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy can distinguish structures of protein amide I among the different feed protein sources. The results show that the secondary structure of feather protein differed from those of other feed protein sources in terms of the line-shape and position of amide I. The feather protein amide I peaked at \u223c1630 cm-1. However, other feed protein sources showed a peak at \u223c1650 cm-1. By using multicomponent peak modeling, the relatively quantitative amounts of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet in protein secondary structure were obtained, which showed that feather contains 88% \u03b2-sheet and 4% \u03b1-helix, barley contains 17% \u03b2-sheet and 71% \u03b1-helix, oat contains 2% \u03b2-sheet and 92% \u03b1-helix, and wheat contains 42% \u03b2-sheet and 50% \u03b1-helix. The difference in percentage of protein secondary structure may be part of the reason for different feed protein digestive behaviors.

The mixture used for the research testing was prepared with a high water content (H2O\/C2H5OH = 8.4 mol\/mol) in order to simulate the composition of the ecological fuel product from vegetable biomass fermentation. The experimental tests were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at a programmed temperature between 323 and 923 K. The maximum temperature (T = 923 K) is the standard working temperature of a molten carbonate fuel cell able to make direct use of the hydrogen produced for ethanol steam reforming. The reaction mechanism starts with the initial dehydrogenation and\/or dehydration of the ethanol, followed by rapid conversion of the products into methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The acid support (Al2O3) assists the dehydration of the alcohol, while all the other reactions are catalyzed by the Rh, although in different measures. For this reason, with increase in Rh content, there is also a progressive increase in the C1 (CH4, CO, and CO2), while the C2 (ethylene, ethanol, and acetaldehyde) disappear gradually from the outlet gaseous stream. The acetaldehyde, that is produced by dehydrogenation, is formed during an intermediate stage, but rapidly decomposes to CH4 and CO when working at high temperatures. Traces of acetaldehyde and hydrogen in a ratio of 1:1 are also present in the reaction products when pure Al2O3 is used. However in this case the main product of the reaction is the ethylene obtained by dehydration on the acid sites of the Al2O3. Obviously the presence of the ethylene assists the formation of carbon whiskers very strongly, which after only a few hours can be easily seen on the depleted catalyst. Vice versa, in the presence of Rh at high temperatures (T = 923 K), coking does not occur and the catalyst maintains its activity for several hours transforming all the ethanol into C1 and H2.

The immobilized antibodies, according to the proposed approach, maintain high antigen binding constants. The immobilization procedure provides orientation of IgG fragments in terms of the similar distance between the binding site of the antibody and the surface of the gold support, which does not cause the distribution of the apparent affinity constants.

Chromatography resolved soil DOC into 3 fractions: high molecular weight (HMW; 0.4\u201310 kDa), low molecular weight (LMW; 50\u2013400 Da), and retained (R) fraction. Sample reproducibility for measurement of \u03b413C-DOC size classes was \u00b10.25\u2030 for HMW fraction, \u00b1 0.54\u2030 for LMW fraction, and \u00b11.3\u2030 for R fraction.

The limit of quantification (SD \u22640.6\u2030) for each size fraction measured as a peak is 200 ng C (2 mg C\/L). \u03b413C-DOC values obtained in SEC mode correlated significantly with those obtained without column in the \u03bcEA mode (p &lt; 0.001, intercept 0.17\u2030), which rules out SEC-associated isotopic effects or DOC loss. In the vegetation change experiment, fractions revealed a clear trend in plant contribution to DOC; those in deeper soils and smaller size fractions had less plant material.

After sorption onto clays, supernatant solutions of the unadsorbed humic fraction yielded lower Koc values than the original bulk humic acid, suggesting that the humic substance was fractionating during its sorption onto the clays. Additionally, the extent of phenanthrene binding with the adsorbed humic fraction was lower than the results determined for the bulk humic acid prior to adsorption.

The quantitative analysis of X-ray scattering and diffraction intensities allows the structures of intermediates to be identified at the different stages of SBA-15 synthesis. Following tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) addition, an intense small-angle scattering and an associated secondary maximum are observed, which are attributed to non-interacting surfactant template micelles encrusted with silicate species. After 25\u221230 min of the reaction, the broad scattering disappears and narrow Bragg diffraction peaks typical of hexagonally ordered structure are observed. The cylindrical micelles identified from X-ray scattering data appear to be the direct precursors of 2D hexagonal SBA-15 structure. Just after the formation of the SBA-15 hexagonal phase, the cylindrical micelles are only weakly linked in the hexagonal structure. As the synthesis proceeds, the solvent in the void volume between the cylindrical micelles is gradually replaced by more dense silicate species. The unit cell parameter of SBA-15 is progressively decreasing during the SBA-15 synthesis, which can be related to the condensation and densification of silicate fragments in the spaces between the cylinders. The volume fraction of the 2D hexagonally ordered phase is sharply growing during the first 2 h of the reaction. The inner core radius of SBA-15 material remains almost constant during the whole synthesis and is principally affected by the size of the poly(propylene oxide) inner core in the original cylindrical micelles.

The aim of the current work was to investigate interactions in ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al2O3, and NOM and how the interactions affect MnO2 oxidative reactivity. For the effect of Al ions, we examined ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al ions, and NOM. Our results indicated that an increase in the amount of humic acids (HAs) increasingly inhibited Al adsorption by forming soluble Al\u2013HA complexes. As a consequence, there was less inhibition on MnO2 reactivity than by the sum of two binary mixtures (MnO2+Al ions and MnO2+HA). Alginate or pyromellitic acid (PA)\u2014two model NOM compounds\u2014did not affect Al adsorption, but Al ions increased alginate\/PA adsorption by MnO2. The latter effect led to more inhibition on MnO2 reactivity than the sum of the two binary mixtures. In ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al2O3, and NOM, NOM inhibited dissolution of Al2O3. Zeta potential measurements, sedimentation experiments, TEM images, and modified DLVO calculations all indicated that HAs of up to 4 mg-C\/L increased heteroaggregation between Al2O3 and MnO2, whereas higher amounts of HAs completely inhibited heteroaggregation. The effect of alginate is similar to that of HAs, although not as significant, while PA had negligible effects on heteroaggregation. Different from the effects of Al ions and NOMs on MnO2 reactivity, the MnO2 reactivity in ternary mixtures of Al2O3, MnO2, and NOM was mostly enhanced. This suggests MnO2 reactivity was mainly affected through heteroaggregation in the ternary mixtures because of the limited availability of Al ions.","level1":["Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry"],"level2":["Inorganic compounds","Physical and chemical properties","Ions","Mixtures","Physical and chemical processes"],"level3":["Reactivity","Adsorption","Oxides"],"levels":["Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Inorganic compounds","Physical and chemical properties","Ions","Mixtures","Physical and chemical processes","Reactivity","Adsorption","Oxides"]},{"title":"Simple and Robust Approach for Passivating and Functionalizing Surfaces for Use in Complex Media","abstract":"Pluronic is a popular triblock copolymer used as a surfactant to introduce hydrophilic coatings onto many different types of material surfaces, from engineering to biomedical applications.

It is known that the catalytic reaction involves a hydride shift from NADPH and a proton transfer from a suitable proton donor to the carbonyl group of the substrate. However, the details of the process are still unclear. The present work explores the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme by using the semi-microscopic protein dipoles Langevin dipoles (PDLD\/S) and the empirical valence bond (EVB) methods. The pKa values of His-110 and Tyr-48 are evaluated to determine which of these two residues donates the proton in the reaction. It is found that the free energy of protonation of His-110 in its protein site is \u223c9 kcal\/mol and hence the pKa of this residue is abnormally low. Consequently, His-110 is not protonated in the active site of aldose reductase. On the other hand, it is found that the pKa of Tyr-48 is lowered to \u223c8.5 in the active site due to the stabilization by the unique local environment of the phenol group. We conclude that Tyr-48 acts as the proton donor in the reduction of aldehydes by aldose reductase, while the neutral His-110 has a role in substrate binding during the catalysis. To obtain a quantitative picture of the energetics of different feasible catalytic mechanisms in the protein we follow the EVB philosophy and calibrate the potential surface of the catalytic reaction in a solvent cage by using the relevant energetics from experiments. It is found that a mechanism where a proton transfer precedes the hydride transfer is unfavorable in the solvent cage, relative to the alternative mechanism where the hydride transfer precedes protonation. Furthermore, our study of the reaction in the actual protein environment indicates that an initial proton transfer step would require prohibitively high energy. Thus, the most probable catalytic mechanism commences with the hydride shift, followed by a proton transfer from Tyr-48. The calculations show that in water the activation barrier for the hydride shift is \u223c20 kcal\/mol, which is far above the barrier of the subsequent proton transfer. The protein environment stabilizes the transition state of the hydride shift by \u223c3 kcal\/mol and destabilizes the intermediate state by \u223c8 kcal\/mol relative to the corresponding states in the water cage. This finding is consistent with the physiological role of the enzyme in detoxification where it catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of carbonyl-containing substrates without particular specificity. It is argued that it may be difficult for an enzyme to both satisfy this demand and catalyze the reaction beyond the simple role of bringing the proton and hydride donor groups to the proximity of the substrate.

Here, we extend our studies on the molecular recognition of the h-P2Y1-R to the exploration of the diastereoselectivity of this receptor. For this purpose, we implemented an integrative approach combining synthesis, spectral analysis, biochemical assays, and computational analysis. Specifically, we selected and synthesized novel ATP analogues bearing a chiral center on the phosphate chain. We analyzed the conformation of the chiral ATP analogues in solution by 1H\/13C NMR and assigned the absolute configuration of the diastereoisomers. The coordination mode of these analogues with a Mg2+ ion was evaluated by 31P NMR. These chiral analogues were biochemically evaluated and found to be potent h-P2Y1-R ligands. An EC50 difference of ca. 20-fold was observed between the diastereoisomers. Their spectral absolute configuration assignment was confirmed by comparison of the biochemical results to those of ATP-\u03b1-S diastereoisomers whose chirality is known. Finally, a computational analysis was performed for the elucidation of molecular recognition employing molecular mechanics (docking) studies on the receptor:ligands complexes. On the basis of the current results, we hypothesize that h-P2Y1-R's chiral discrimination originates from the requirement that the nucleotide analogue interacts with a Mg2+ ion within the receptor binding site. This Mg2+ ion is possibly coordinated with both Asp204 and the ATP's \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3-phosphates in a \u039b configuration.

Given that conjugated polymer films cast in different ways also show different nanometer-scale surface topographies, the question that arises is:\u2009 What is the correlation between surface topography, local chain packing, and the local electronic properties of a conjugated polymer film? In this paper, we address this question using fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) to examine films of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2\u2018-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) that were prepared in different ways. The spatially resolved photoluminescence (SRPL) spectra collected on top of the nanometer-scale topographic features (\u201cbumps\u201d) exhibited by spin-cast MEH-PPV films show an enhancement of the red portion of the emission relative to spectra collected from flat regions of the film. Moreover, photooxidative damage (signified by a red-shift and drop in quantum yield of the SRPL) occurs much more quickly in the flat regions of the MEH-PPV films than on the topographic bumps. Taken together, these observations suggest that the bumps on the films correspond to regions in which the chains are packed more tightly:\u2009 the red-shifted emission results from increased interchain interactions, while the decreased photooxidation rate results from the fact that oxygen cannot easily diffuse between the tightly packed polymer chains. We also find that the spatial homogeneity of MEH-PPV films can be greatly improved by annealing:\u2009 heating the films above the glass transition temperature removes the topographic features and produces a uniform but weak and red-shifted SRPL due to increased interchain interactions. In contrast to spin-cast films, the SRPL of annealed films undergoes a blue-shift upon photooxidation. This result can be explained by considering the differences between the local chain packing in annealed and nonannealed films, combined with the fact that excitations in the film tend to migrate to low-energy aggregated-chain \u201ctraps\u201d. All of these results provide insight into how polymer film morphology can be controlled through film processing conditions to improve the optical properties and the performance of electroluminescent devices based on this class of materials.

An efficient synthesis of PCP2A is based on the macrocyclization reaction between 2,6-bis(chloromethyl)pyridine and a 1,4,7-triazaheptane derivative bearing a methylenephosphonate group on N-4. The Gd(III) complex of PCP2A displays characteristic properties which make it a very promising contrast agent for improved applications in magnetic resonance imaging. In fact it shows (i) a very high stability constant (log KGdPCP2A = 23.4) which should guarantee against the in vivo release of toxic free Gd(III) ions and free ligand molecules and (ii) a relaxivity that is about 2 times higher than the values reported for contrast agents currently used in the clinical practice. Its high relaxivity is the result of the presence of two water molecules in the inner coordination sphere and a significant contribution from water molecule(s) hydrogen bonded to the phosphonate group. Moreover, the inner sphere water molecules are involved in an exchange with the bulk water which is relatively fast. This property is important for the attainment of an even higher relaxivity once the molecular reorientation rate of the [GdPCP2A(H2O)2]- moiety is lengthened by means of conjugation to a macromolecular substrate.

Because of their large application to agriculture fields and the toxicity of MMA and DMA, the persistency of these compounds in the environment is of great concern. MMA and DMA sorption and desorption were investigated in soils, varying in mineralogical and organic matter (OM) contents. Sorption studies showed that the MMA sorption capacity and rate were greater than DMA sorption. Al\/Fe-oxyhydroxides were the main sorbents in the soils, and the sorption capacity was proportional to the Al\/Fe concentration in the soils. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies showed that both MMA\/DMA-Fe interatomic distances were around 3.3 \u00c5, which were indicative of bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complex formation. Desorption studies showed that not all of the sorbed MMA or DMA was desorbed due to the strong binding between MMA\/DMA and Al\/Fe-oxyhydroxide surfaces via possible inner-sphere complex formation. The amount of the desorbed MMA and DMA decreased as the sorption residence time increased. For example, 77% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the Reybold subsoil after 1 day residence time, while 66% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the soil after six months of residence time. The decreases in desorption were likely due to As speciation changes from MMA\/DMA to inorganic arsenate, which was more strongly bound to the surface.","level1":["Physical chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Earth, space, and environmental chemistry"],"level2":["Physical and chemical processes","Soil science","Minerals","Surface science"],"level3":["Soils","Sorption","Desorption"],"levels":["Physical chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Earth, space, and environmental chemistry","Physical and chemical processes","Soil science","Minerals","Surface science","Soils","Sorption","Desorption"]},{"title":"Multiresponsive Star-Graft Quarterpolymer Monolayers","abstract":"Multifunctional star-graft quarterpolymers PSn[P2VP-b-(PAA-g-PNIPAM)]n with two different arm types, shorter PS arms and longer P2VP-b-PAA block copolymer arms with grafted PNIPAM chains, were studied in terms of their ability to form micellar structures at the air\/water and air\/solid interfaces. Because of the pH-dependent ionization of P2VP and PAA blocks, as well as thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAM chains, these multifunctional stars have multiple responsive properties to pH, temperature, and ionic strength. We observed that the molecular surface area of the stars is the largest at basic pH, when the PAA blocks are strongly charged and extended, and PNIPAM chains are spread at the interface. At acidic conditions, the molecular surface area is the smallest because the P2VP blocks submerge into the water subphase and the PAA blocks are contracted and form hydrogen bonding with grafted PNIPAM chains. The molecular surface area of the stars at the air\/water interface gradually increases at elevated temperature. We suggest that the transition across lower critical solution temperature (LCST) results in the emerging of PNIPAM chains from the water subphase to the interface due to the hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition. Moreover, at higher surface pressure, the stars tend to form intermolecular micellar aggregates above LCST. The graft density of PNIPAM chains as well as the arm number was also found to have strong effects on the thermo- and pH-response. Overall, this study demonstrates that the star block copolymer conformation and aggregation are strongly dependent on the intramolecular interactions between different blocks and spatial distribution of the arms, which can be controlled by the external conditions, including pH, temperature, ionic strength, and surface pressure.","level1":["Physical chemistry","Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Polymer science"],"level2":["Polymers","Transport phenomena","Surface science"],"level3":["Monolayers","Interfaces","Aggregation","Copolymers","Thermoresponsive polymers"],"levels":["Physical chemistry","Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Polymer science","Polymers","Transport phenomena","Surface science","Monolayers","Interfaces","Aggregation","Copolymers","Thermoresponsive polymers"]},{"title":"Isotope Fractionation Associated with the Indirect Photolysis of Substituted Anilines in Aqueous Solution","abstract":"Organic micropollutants containing aniline substructures are susceptible to different light-induced transformation processes in aquatic environments and water treatment operations.

II. Compatibility of an Extended Model with Previously Reported Model-Data Correspondences","abstract":"In the course of formulating detailed models of complex chemical reactions, it is sometimes the case that modifications intended to account for one set of experimental observations wind up destroying a model's ability to account for other results. Here, we consider a recently proposed model of the peroxidase-oxidase reaction which derives from an earlier scheme via the addition of NADH oxidation by superoxide anion or its protonated form, hydroperoxyl radical. This modification was introduced to account for the observation of bistability and bursting at enzyme concentrations less than 0.5 \u03bcM. Left unanswered in our previous paper was the matter of whether the proposed \u201cfix\u201d invalidates previously published examples of model-data agreement at higher enzyme concentrations. In the present paper, we show that under these latter circumstances, the new mechanism is as good as, and in some instances superior to, its predecessor. More generally, we argue that the consequences of NADH oxidation by O2- or HO2\u2022 should be manifest principally at low enzyme concentrations, thereby offering a \u201cglobal\u201d explanation of our findings. Neither our original model, nor the derivative scheme treated here, provides for reactions involving NAD dimers, a species in which there has recently been renewed interest. Most importantly, it has been proposed to replace the reduction of coIII (an enzyme intermediate) by NAD radicals, a reaction for which there is no direct evidence, with the corresponding reaction involving NAD2. While a detailed assessment of the consequences of dimer chemistry to theoretical peroxidase-oxidase dynamics is beyond the scope of the present investigation, it is easily documented that this substitution, by itself, abolishes oscillatory behavior for all model parametrizations previously considered. Moreover, this result appears to obtain for arbitrarily small values of the associated rate constant. Whether or not the inclusion of additional dimer reactions can restore the model's ability to account for experimental observations of complex dynamics remains to be determined.

One interesting observation is that Am(VI) shows increased stability in the cocrystallized form, with no reduction observed after 13 days, as opposed to in solution, in which &gt;50% is reduced after only 10 days. The ability to cocrystallize and stabilize hexavalent actinides from solution, especially Am(VI), introduces a new separations approach that can be applied to closing the nuclear fuel cycle.","level1":["Nuclear chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Materials science"],"level2":["Nuclear reactions","Acid and base chemistry","Ions","Materials","Physical and chemical processes"],"level3":["Nuclear fission","Crystals","Acidity","Crystallization"],"levels":["Nuclear chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Materials science","Nuclear reactions","Acid and base chemistry","Ions","Materials","Physical and chemical processes","Nuclear fission","Crystals","Acidity","Crystallization"]},{"title":"Catalytic Hydrogenation of Squalene to Squalane","abstract":"Full hydrogenation of squalene, a natural product, affords squalane, a saturated hydrocarbon whose exceptional properties make it the best emollient known to the cosmetic industry.

Median levels of PCBs were similar at all stations except at one urban site near Riga. A latitudinal gradient with higher levels in the south was found for the sum of PCB as well as for individual congeners, and the gradient was more pronounced for the low volatility congeners. As a result, the high volatility congeners increased in relative importance with latitude. Generally, PCB concentrations increased with temperature, but slopes of the partial pressure in air versus reciprocal temperature were different between congeners and between stations. In general, the low volatility congeners were more temperature dependent than the high volatility PCB congeners. Steep slopes at a sampling location indicate that the concentration in air is largely determined by diffusive exchange with soils.

Four different cobalt redox systems with potentials spanning a 0.3 V range were studied, and the carrier recombination and regeneration kinetics were monitored both at low and at high TiO2 (e\u2013) densities (1.3 \u00d7 1018 and 1.3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u20133, respectively). The results reveal that the introduction of the TPAA intermediate more effectively suppress the recombination loss of TiO2 (e\u2013) under high charge conditions, close to open-circuit, as compared to low charge conditions.

Furthermore, an unprecedented detrimental impact of TPAA on the device performance was identified when the redox potential of the TPAA donor and the cobalt complexes are close. This is ascribed to the formation of TPAA\u2022+ which can act as an active recombination centers and thus lower the solar cell performance.

The signal decays in the PFG experiments have been recorded for 1 wt % F127 in the temperature range from 288 to 313 K and in the concentration range 0.1\u221235 wt % at 298 K. Below the critical micellization temperature (cmt) or the critical micellization concentration (cmc), the PFG signal decays approximately linearly when the intensities are plotted on a logarithmic scale versus the experimentally relevant parameter. At the cmt or cmc, the signal decays are curved. The NMR data were processed using inverse Laplace transformation to obtain the distribution of self-diffusion coefficients, P(D). At 288 K for a 1 wt % solution, a narrow distribution was observed, while at 302 K a bimodal distribution was observed. This observation can be explained by the polydispersity of the polymer. It implies that, at a given temperature, only the more hydrophobic compound of F127 takes part in the aggregation process, while the more hydrophilic components diffuse as free nonassociated polymer. Increasing the temperature to 313 K resulted in a monomodal distribution, suggesting that all the polymers are aggregated. It is suggested that an ideal mixing model for the Pluronic micelles can explain the self-diffusion data.

In addition, temperature-programmed reduction showed that palladium promoted both the reduction and reoxidation of the support. When the role of CO2 was investigated in the absence of gas-phase oxidant, using a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor, it was found that CO2 dissociates over the reduced catalyst, leading to formation of CO and selective oxygen species.

These two mechanistic functions have previously been considered to be mutually exclusive.","level1":["Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Materials science","Catalysis"],"level2":["Catalysts","Materials","Chemical reactions","Elements"],"level3":["Oxygen","Redox reactions","Palladium"],"levels":["Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Materials science","Catalysis","Catalysts","Materials","Chemical reactions","Elements","Oxygen","Redox reactions","Palladium"]},{"title":"Synthetic and Computational Studies on the Thermal and Photochemical Reactions of [NPN]TaMe<sub>3<\/sub> (NPN = PhP(CH<sub>2<\/sub>SiMe<sub>2<\/sub>NPh)<sub>2<\/sub>) and [<sup>Mes<\/sup>NPN]TaMe<sub>3<\/sub> (<sup>Mes<\/sup>NPN = PhP(CH<sub>2<\/sub>SiMe<sub>2<\/sub>N(2,4,6-Me<sub>3<\/sub>C<sub>6<\/sub>H<sub>2<\/sub>))<sub>2<\/sub>)","abstract":"The thermolysis of [PhP(CH2SiMe2NPh)2]TaMe3 leads to the elimination of methane and the formation of cyclometalated derivative [PhP(CH2SiMe2NPh)(CH2SiMe2N-o-C6H4)]TaMe2, which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray analysis.

These enzymes exhibit little sequence similarity in their substrates binding domains, but share a highly conserved catalytic site, suggesting a similar activation mechanism for the oxidation of their substrates. In this study, the fully conserved histidine residue at position 466 of choline oxidase was replaced with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis and the biochemical, spectroscopic, and mechanistic properties of the resulting CHO-H466A mutant enzyme were characterized. CHO-H466A showed kcat and kcat\/Km values with choline as substrate that were 60- and 1000-fold lower than the values for the wild-type enzyme, while the kcat\/Km value for oxygen was unaffected, suggesting the involvement of His466 in the oxidation of the alcohol substrate but not in the reduction of oxygen. Replacement of His466 with alanine significantly affected the microenvironment of the flavin, as indicated by the altered behavior of CHO-H466A with sulfite and dithionite. In agreement with this conclusion, a midpoint reduction potential of +106 mV for the two-electron transfer in the catalytically competent enzyme\u2212product complex was determined at pH 7 for CHO-H466A, which was \u223c25 mV more negative than that of the wild-type enzyme. Enzymatic activity in CHO-H466A could be partially rescued with exogenous imidazolium, but not imidazole, consistent with the protonated form of histidine exerting a catalytic role. pH profiles for glycine betaine inhibition, the deprotonation of the N(3)-flavin locus, and the kcat\/Km value for choline all showed a significant shift upward in their pKa values, consistent with a change in the polarity of the active site. Finally, kinetic isotope effects with isotopically labeled substrate and solvent indicated that the histidine to alanine substitution affected the timing of substrate OH and CH bond cleavages, consistent with removal of the hydroxyl proton being concerted with hydride transfer in the mutant enzyme. All taken together, the results presented in this study suggest that in choline oxidase, His466 modulates the electrophilicity of the enzyme-bound flavin and the polarity of the active site, and contributes to the stabilization of the transition state for the oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde.

Some of these could be straightforwardly related to the differences in the sample morphology and known effects of platelet activation, but others are more subtle. Strikingly, it was possible to differentiate between these samples by ToF-SIMS\/PCA of the protein species alone. This clearly indicates that the composition, orientation, and\/or conformation of the proteins in these specimens depend both on the platelets' presence and on their activation. The ToF-SIMS imaging functionality furthermore provides unique insight into the distribution of phospholipid species in these samples.","level1":["Physical chemistry","Biology and biological chemistry","Inorganic chemistry"],"level2":["Inorganic compounds","Biochemistry","Ions","Cell and molecular biology","Surface science"],"level3":["Interfaces","Cells","Peptides and proteins","Oxides"],"levels":["Physical chemistry","Biology and biological chemistry","Inorganic chemistry","Inorganic compounds","Biochemistry","Ions","Cell and molecular biology","Surface science","Interfaces","Cells","Peptides and proteins","Oxides"]},{"title":"An Efficient Binding Chemistry for Glass Polynucleotide Microarrays","abstract":"A variety of methods have been described for making synthetic polynucleotide microarrays.

Wet milling is robust, relatively easy to use, broadly applicable, and offers both financial and API physical property advantages over dry milling. Historical rotor\u2013stator wet mill technologies are generally capable of achieving particles sizes down to \u223c25 \u03bcm. Newer high-shear wet mills allow for a reduction of particle size down to \u223c10\u201315 \u03bcm. In addition to the improved particle size reduction, recent wet mill designs better maintain geometric consistency across the product line, thereby providing enhanced scalability. A traditional scale-up approach for wet milling involved maintaining the tip speed of the rotor (assuming constant shear gap and thus constant shear rate) and would generally allow comparable terminal particle size (that near steady-state particle size where particle size reduction drastically slows) across scales. In order to predict the milling time upon scale-up the number of passes, or batch turnover, through the mill was kept constant. However, this prediction of the required milling time was often less successful than the prediction of the terminal particle size. Studies presented here confirmed the importance of maintaining constant rotor tip speed across scales to achieve the predicted terminal particle size and identified the importance of additional parameters to address particle breakage kinetics to allow prediction of the required milling time to achieve the target particle size. Additional aspects of hydrodynamics, shear rates, and equipment properties were assessed as part of these scale-up model optimization efforts. Specific processing parameters evaluated included flow rate, API slurry solids concentration, and starting particle size distribution. Ultimately, the Slot Event Model was developed to incorporate the critical geometric parameters by considering the frequency and the probability of a slot event. In addition to applying the revised model across scales, further model verification was achieved by evaluating custom rotor\u2013stator mill heads. Studies with these custom mill heads provided insight into the importance of mill efficiency and slot events. This, in turn, allowed for more accurate scale-up of not only the terminal particle size but also the milling time required to achieve the target particle size. The success of the optimized model reduces the reliance on in-process controls or at-line testing for determining the end point of milling.","level1":["Physical chemistry","Theoretical and computational chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Materials science"],"level2":["Physical and chemical properties","Mathematical methods","Kinetics","Materials","Stress"],"level3":["Particle size"],"levels":["Physical chemistry","Theoretical and computational chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Materials science","Physical and chemical properties","Mathematical methods","Kinetics","Materials","Stress","Particle size"]},{"title":"Ternary Nanoparticles with a Sheddable Shell Efficiently Deliver MicroRNA-34a against CD44-Positive Melanoma","abstract":"PEGylation can stabilize drug delivery systems for cancer therapy by creating repulsive interactions with biological components in vivo.

Positively charged polycation nanoparticles were assembled with microRNA-34a via electrostatic interactions and then coated again via electrostatic interactions with an anionic PEG derivative that separates from the nanoparticle in the acidic tumor microenvironment. The resulting ternary nanoparticles with a sheddable shell have nearly neutral surface charge, which markedly reduces nonspecific adsorption.

The blue compound 1 is formed by wheel-shaped cationic heptameric units where the copper atoms are bridged by hydroxide anions, water molecules, and adeninato ligands with a \u03bc-\u03baN3:\u03baN9 coordination mode. The assembly of the heptameric entities and the theobrominate anions takes place mainly through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions involving the adeninato ligands and theobrominate moieties. Although compound 1 exhibits an open-framework with voids representing 37% of the unit cell, the plasticity of the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions causes a reversible shrinkage of the porous system upon activation that precludes the adsorption of gas molecules. Dark purple compounds 2\u20134 contain neutral windmill units in which two copper atoms are bridged by four \u03bc-\u03baN3:\u03baN9 adeninato ligands. Their final crystal structure highly depends on the supramolecular interactions of the theobromine and caffeine molecules. In compound 2, two theobromine molecules are hydrogen bonded to the Hoogsteen face of two trans-arranged adeninato ligands, whereas a third theobromine molecule is joined to the Watson\u2013Crick face of one of the previous adeninato ligands. In compound 3, with a lower amount of theobromine, the Watson\u2013Crick interaction is not present. In both compounds, the three-dimensional (3D) crystal structure requires the additional presence of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacks between the theobromine molecules. In compound 4, as the methyl groups of the caffeine molecule do not allow hydrogen bond interactions, the adeninato ligands are hydrogen bonded among them to generate, together with \u03c0-stacking interactions, two-dimensional supramolecular sheets containing rectangular windows in which the caffeine molecules are located. Only compound 4 showed permanent porosity, adsorbing a significant amount of CO2 (0.88 mmol of CO2\/g at 5 bar and 273 K).

However, a large amount of binders and conductive agents are still required for the reliable performance of Si anodes. Herein, we have introduced free-standing Si electrodes, which show suppressed swelling property (31.29%) after the 100th cycle in spite of no binders. Carbon-coated Si nanoparticle (NP) via thermal decomposition of acetylene (C2H2) gas was confined in the bundles of copper nanowires (Cu NWs) that provide not only high electrical conductivity but also accommodation of volume changes of Si NPs. The carbon coating layer helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the surface of Si NPs. Furthermore, two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide effectively combines Si NPs and Cu NWs, which maintains the electron pathway and structural stability of electrodes during cycling.

Both 1 and 2 feature three-coordinate zinc centers in the solid state. Reaction of 2 equiv of ZnPh2 with N,N\u2018-bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)dibenzofuran-4,6-diamine (MeLH2) forms MeLZn2Ph2 (3), which was isolated in 73% yield. The analogous reaction using iPrLH2 instead of MeLH2 forms iPrLZn2Ph2 (4), which was isolated in 56% yield.

In contrast, the 1H NMR spectrum of 3 (CD2Cl2) indicates overall C2v symmetry; this is likely due to cleavage of the phenyl bridges in solution. The solid-state structure of 4, which features the bulkier iPr-substituted ligand, reveals the absence of Ph bridges. Instead, each molecule of 4 has a pair of essentially noninteracting three-coordinate Zn centers. Benzene solutions of 3 react with 1 equiv of benzaldehyde to form the addition product MeLZn2(Ph)(OCHPh2) (5) in 87% isolated yield.

PFO was substituted with a single cysteine at most of the residues between amino acids K189 and N218, and then each cysteine was modified with NBD. Each purified NBD-labeled PFO was then bound to membranes, and the probe's environment was ascertained by measuring its fluorescence lifetime, emission intensity, and collisional quenching with either aqueous (iodide ions) or nonaqueous (nitroxide-labeled phospholipids) quenchers. Lifetime and intensity measurements revealed that the amino acid side chains in this region of the membrane-bound PFO polypeptide alternated between being in an aqueous or a nonaqueous environment. This pattern indicates that this portion of the membrane-bound PFO spans the membrane in an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet conformation. The alternating exposure of these residues to the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer was demonstrated by their susceptibility to quenching by nitroxide moieties attached to phospholipid acyl chains. Residues K189\u2212N218 therefore form a two-stranded, amphipathic \u03b2-sheet in the membrane-bound PFO that creates a stable interface between the pore and the membrane. This same region packs as three short \u03b1-helices in the soluble, monomeric form of PFO, and therefore, the cholesterol-dependent conversion of PFO to a membrane-bound oligomer involves a major structural transition in which three \u03b1-helices unfold to form a membrane-spanning amphipathic \u03b2-sheet.

Reducing the electroactive area of the substrate easily controls the number of nucleation sites. With the use of substrates having electroactive radii of a few nanometers, it is possible to form only one single growth center and to allow that center to grow independently. The current transient associated with the growth of such a single nucleus provides both kinetic and mechanistic information about the electrodeposition process. A mathematical formula for the current transient under combined electrokinetic and mass-transport control based on the work of Fletcher [J. Cryst. Growth 1983, 62, 505] and Kruijt et al. [J.

For the Pt on carbon deposition process at low overpotentials, for which the electron-transfer steps control the overall deposition process, single nucleation is observed when the electrode is smaller than about 5 nm in size. It is found that the single nucleation and growth processes can also occur at relatively large electrodes (\u223c100 nm in size) when a high overpotential is applied so that a diffusion-controlled deposition process is established.

SWOT has been used extensively in business settings to uncover new outlooks and identify problems that would impede progress. The field of environmental metabolomics provides great opportunities for discovery, and this is recognized by a high level of interest in potential applications. However, understanding the biological consequence of environmental exposures can be confounded by inter- and intra-individual differences. Metabolomic profiles can yield a plethora of data, the interpretation of which is complex and still being evaluated and researched. The development of the field will depend on the availability of technologies for data handling and that permit ready access metabolomic databases. Understanding the relevance of metabolomic endpoints to organism health vs adaptation vs variation is an important step in understanding what constitutes a substantive environmental threat. Metabolomic applications in reproductive research are discussed.

In the low-acid region, the metal ion remains with its waters of hydration and does not coordinate to the carbonyl oxygens. As the acid concentration exceeds 2 M, protonation of the amide occurs to form an iminium moiety, electrostatically attracting the anionic lanthanide complex through ion-exchange and releasing waters of hydration.

It was found that adsorption of the polymers on the surfaces of cocrystals might prevent the precipitation of the parent drug and alter the dissolution rate. The effect of polymers on precipitation could be determined by the cocrystal dissolution rate, the interactions of polymers with the surfaces of cocrystals, the characters of the noncovalent bonds formed between the polymers and the cocrystal surfaces, and the mobility and conformation of the polymers. The etching experiments of single cocrystals revealed that FFA-NIC and CBZ-NIC appeared as surface precipitation cocrystals while FFA-TP could lead to bulk precipitation. Both PVP and PVP-VA were good precipitation inhibitors for FFA-NIC, and they could completely inhibit the recrystallization of FFA III on the surfaces of dissolving cocrystals. In addition, as the adsorption of the polymer was slower than dissolution rate of the cocrystals, PVP and PVP-VA could only partially inhibit the recrystallization of CBZ dihydrate on the surface of CBZ-NIC. While PEG had no inhibitory effect on the surface crystallization of FFA-NIC and CBZ-NIC, due to its weak interactions with the surfaces of the cocrystals, it enhanced the dissolution performance of FFA-TP. In contrast, PVP and PVP-VA reduced the dissolution rate of FFA-TP and subsequently undermined the performance of cocrystals.

The practice of water ICE was shown feasible for very weak acids like silicate and borate with a dedicated element specific detector like an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS), but this is rarely practical in most laboratories. Direct conductometric detection is possible for H2CO3 but because of its weak nature, not especially sensitive; complex multistep ion exchange methods do not markedly improve this LOD. It will clearly be impractical in acids that are weaker still. By using a permeative amine introduction device (PAID,  Anal. Chem. 2016, 88, 2198\u20132204) as a conductometric developing agent, we demonstrate that a variety of weak acids (silicate, borate, arsenite, cyanide, carbonate, and sulfide) cannot only be separated on an ion exclusion column, they can be sensitively detected (LODs 0.2\u20130.4 \u03bcM). We observe that the elution order is essentially the same as that on a nonfunctionalized poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) column using 1\u201310% acetonitrile as eluent and follows the reverse order of the polar surface area (PSA) of the analyte molecules. PSA values have been widely used to predict biological transport of pharmaceuticals across a membrane but never to predict chromatographic behavior. We demonstrate the application of the technique by measuring the silicate and borate depth profiles in the Pacific Ocean; the silicate results show an excellent match with results from a reference laboratory.","level1":["Physical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Inorganic chemistry"],"level2":["Ions","Chemical structure","Inorganic compounds","Chromatography"],"level3":["Inorganic carbon compounds","Order","Anions"],"levels":["Physical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Inorganic chemistry","Ions","Chemical structure","Inorganic compounds","Chromatography","Inorganic carbon compounds","Order","Anions"]},{"title":"Designed Surface with Tunable IgG Density as an <i>in Vitro<\/i> Model for Immune Complex Mediated Stimulation of Leukocytes","abstract":"We present the design of an in vitro model for immune-complex-mediated stimulation of leukocytes and its functional characteristics with respect to monocyte adhesion.

Adult male rats were exposed to normal light-dark cycles, constant light (LL), constant dark, and LL+Flx (5 mg\/kg\/day, ZT5) for four months. The expression of molecular markers of circadian rhythm: Per2 transcripts; and protein expression of peroxiredoxin-1 (PRX1) and hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (PRX-SO2\/3) were significantly dysregulated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of LL rats, which was prevented with concomitant fluoxetine administration. The levels of glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid were dysregulated, and oxidative damage was observed in the SCN and hippocampi of LL rats. Fluoxetine treatment conferred protection against oxidative damage in LL rats. Constant light exposure also impaired rats\u2019 performance on Y-maze, Morris maze, and novel object recognition test, which was prevented with fluoxetine administration.

The most effective system is the ferrocene-functionalized silica film prepared from 40% organosilane, which is able to deliver a capacity of 105 C cm\u20133 (1.10 mC cm\u20132) at a current density of 0.4 A cm\u20133 (with up to 48% capacity retention achieved at a charging time as short as 2.8 s). Such an electrode can be associated to an electrodeposited graphene anode in a solid-state battery\u2013capacitor hybrid device, which can deliver 0.74 mC cm\u20132 at a potential scan rate of 20 mV s\u20131. The azide-functionalized mesoporous silica film is actually a versatile platform that can be functionalized with different redox molecules, as shown here for cobaltocenium moieties, which may broaden its application field.","level1":["Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Materials science","Energy","Inorganic chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts"],"level2":["Chemical reactions","Electrochemical engineering","Energy storage","Solid state chemistry","Materials","Minerals"],"level3":["Silica","Redox reactions","Electrodes","Thin films"],"levels":["Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Materials science","Energy","Inorganic chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Chemical reactions","Electrochemical engineering","Energy storage","Solid state chemistry","Materials","Minerals","Silica","Redox reactions","Electrodes","Thin films"]},{"title":"Challenging Compounds for Calculating Hyperpolarizabilities: <i>p<\/i>-Quinodimethane Derivatives","abstract":"The hyperpolarizabilities of three p-quinodimethane derivatives with low diradical character have been evaluated.

Part 2. Development of a PRF Kinetic Model Including 1,3-Cyclohexadiene Mechanism and Simulations of Ignition Control","abstract":"Autoignition control of fuel and air mixtures was simulated using an additive able to change its molecular structure upon light irradiation. This control was assumed to be feasible through the photochemical isomerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) to cis-1,3,5-hexatriene (1,3,5-HT). 1,3-CHD was present in a molar concentration of 1% in a PRF fuel and was transformed into 1,3,5-HT in varying amounts prior to ignition, in an attempt to control autoignition timing. The autoignition delays were calculated using a newly developed chemical kinetic mechanism for the low temperature combustion of PRF\/1,3-CHD\/1,3,5-HT mixtures in air. Validations for  PRF\/air mixtures were performed by simulations based on the new mechanism developed in the current work against ignition delay times (IDT) of the literature measured in rapid compression machines. The agreement between simulations and experiments for the pure compounds reinforced the accuracy of the mechanism, which led to an investigation of its impact on the IDTs for the addition of 1,3-CHD to PRF90. The computations showed that 1,3-CHD was an ignition enhancer, with a similar boosting effect to that of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate. Simulations predicted that the extent of ignition enhancing of 1,3-CHD can be controlled by the pressure because of the specific combustion chemistry that rules the ignition enhancing capacity of this compound. Additions of 1,3-CHD were found to promote the reactivity of a PRF90 to a greater extent than the addition of 1,3,5-HT. Simple single-zone modeling showed that ignition in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine may be controlled if the fuel is photochemically isomerized using light-irradiation prior to the combustion process.","level1":["Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Energy","Inorganic chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Theoretical and computational chemistry"],"level2":["Chemical reactions","Molecular modeling","Fuels","Additives","Mixtures"],"level3":["Redox reactions","Kinetic modeling"],"levels":["Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Energy","Inorganic chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Theoretical and computational chemistry","Chemical reactions","Molecular modeling","Fuels","Additives","Mixtures","Redox reactions","Kinetic modeling"]},{"title":"Complex Interactions with the Surroundings Dictate a Tagged Chain\u2019s Dynamics in Unentangled Polymer Melts","abstract":"For more than half a century the theoretical landscape for single chain dynamics for dense polymeric solutions and melts below the entanglement threshold has been dominated by the Rouse model for independent phantom chains, supported by ideas of hydrodynamic screening. There exists, however, a large body of literature from experiments, Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations on the deviations from the Rouse behavior for unentangled homopolymer melts, showcased mostly in the subdiffusive behavior of center-of-mass of tagged chains at intermediate times, with the subdiffusion exponent reported in the range 0.75\u20130.85. The influence of the surrounding chains of length Ns on the motion of a single tagged chain of length N is a key test, by which, through high-precision numerical simulation of unentangled melts, we show that the Rouse model fails. Our central results are that at intermediate times the tagged chain\u2019s center-of-mass moves subdiffusively, \u27e8\u0394r2cm\u27e9 \u221d t\u03b1 with subdiffusion exponent \u03b1 = 0.87 \u00b1 0.03 as opposed to \u03b1Rouse = 1, and that its crossover time to Fickian behavior is directly controlled by the relaxation time of the surrounding chains when the latter are shorter. The terminal relaxation time for the tagged chain and the long time diffusion coefficient are then sensitive to Ns. Both measured exponent flow, that is plots of d\u03b1(t)\/d ln (t) vs \u03b1(t) where \u03b1(t) is the effective exponent between \u27e8\u0394r2cm\u27e9 and t, and successful blob scaling arguments support the anomalous value of \u03b1 as a true exponent. We find the same exponent in the scaling of Rouse mode amplitude correlation functions and directly related exponent for the monomeric diffusion. We show that the consequences of these results on the dynamics of a tagged monomer and the chain\u2019s segmental orientation autocorrelation function agree very well with rheological measurements and NMR relaxometry experiments.

However, the Johari\u2013Goldstein (JG) relaxation times, \u03c4JG, do not conform to this density scaling for the same value of the exponent \u03b3. Likewise, the frequency separation of the \u03b1 and JG loss peaks in the spectrum increases with pressure for constant \u03c4\u03b1; that is, state points having the same \u03b1 relaxation time and same peak breadth have different \u03c4JG.

Nevertheless an adiabatic formalism is often used in a zeroth-order description of the processes; for time-periodic perturbations the Floquet theory has been used within an adiabatic framework to provide a compact dynamical theory which requires a basis composed of only a small number of Floquet eigenstates. The use of the generalized Floquet theory or of the concept of a super-adiabatic basis allows the adiabatic approach to be further extended to handle systems with quasi-periodic Hamiltonians. The present work proposes a new approach, in which the time duration of the interaction is artificially prolonged and special absorbing boundary conditions are introduced asymptotically over the lengthened time interval in such a way as to force the adiabaticity of the process. The method involves what can be thought of as time-dependent optical potentials. Some trial applications to semiclassical inelastic collisions and to photodissociation effects have shown that the use of the new technique permits a description of the dynamical processes which is so economical that the use of a single generalized Floquet eigenvector will suffice. The main technical feature of this constrained adiabatic trajectory method is that it converts the problem of solving the TDSE with an explicitly time-dependent potential into that of solving a static complex eigenvalue problem.

A surface restricts the configurational space available to the pair of interacting molecules, thus changing the effective interactions between them. Because of this restriction, a surface can promote chiral separation of mixtures that are racemic in bulk. In this paper, we investigate chiral symmetry breaking induced by an achiral surface in a racemate. A parallel tempering Monte Carlo algorithm with tempering over the temperature domain is used to examine the interplay between molecular geometry and energetics in promoting chiral separations. The system is restricted to evolve in two dimensions. By controlling the balance between electrostatic and steric interactions, one can direct the surface assembly of the chiral molecules toward formation of small clusters of identical molecules. When molecular shape asymmetry is complemented by dipolar alignment, chiral micellar clusters of like molecules are assembled on the surface. We examine the case of small model molecules for which the two-dimensional restriction of the pair potential is sufficient to induce chiral segregation. An increase in molecular complexity can change the balance of intermolecular interactions to the point that heterochiral pairs are energetically more favored. In this case, we find conditions in which formation of homochiral micelles is still achieved, due to a combination of multibody and entropic effects. In such systems, an examination of the pair potential alone is insufficient to predict whether the multimolecular racemate will or will not segregate.

At equilibrium, two species are found in slow exchange. We observe that the deoxyribosylurea residue can be either intra- or extrahelical within structures which otherwise do not deviate strongly from that of a B-DNA as observed by NMR. Our study suggests that this is determined by the nature and number of hydrogen bonds which this residue can form as a function of two possible isomers. There are two possible structures for the urea side chain, either cis or trans for the urido bond which significantly changes the hydrogen bonding geometry of the residue. In the intrahelical species, the cis isomer can form two good hydrogen bonds with the bases on the opposite strand in the intrahelical species, A4 and C5, which is not the case for the trans isomer. This results in a kink in the helical axis. For the major extrahelical species, the situation is reversed. The trans isomer is able to form two good hydrogen bonds, with G13 on the same strand and A7 on the opposite strand. For the extrahelical species, the cis isomer can form only one hydrogen bond. In this major structure the NMR data show that the bases which are on either side of the deoxyribosylurea residue in the sequence, G14 and T16, are stacked over each other in a way similar to a normal B-DNA structure. This requires the formation of a loop for the backbone between these two residues. This loop can belong to one of two families, right- or left-handed. In a previous study of an abasic frameshift [Cuniasse et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2018\u22122026], a left-handed loop was observed, whereas in this study a right-handed loop is found for the first time in solution.

The chemical transformation of oleic acid-functionalized lignin (OAFL) under the UV irradiation was the free radical-based cross-linking reaction assisted by atmospheric oxygen, which successfully formed oxidatively cross-linked networks of lignin derivatives at the surface of the fiber. We observed that OAFL showed more rapid oxidative cross-linking than stearic acid-functionalized lignin (SAFL) because the presence of carbon\u2013carbon double bond in OAFL contributed to the formation of more stable allyl radicals in addition to alkyl radicals under the UV irradiation. This UV pretreatment played a pivotal role in the conversion of flexible pristine OAFL fibers into infusible fibers during the subsequent thermostabilization step at the elevation rate of 2 \u00b0C\/min without melt deformation. As the elevation rate of 2 \u00b0C\/min is among the fastest thermostabilization process for lignin-derived carbon fibers, the duration of the thermostabilization of the OAFL-derived fibers in this study (\u223c2 h) is considerably less than previously reported ones. In addition, the UV irradiation process in this study requires less power (150 W) and exposure time (8 min), which can be appreciated by carbon fiber manufacturers aiming to reduce the fabrication cost.

In comparison to a conventional electrochemical cell, the voltammetric response of the bipolar cell has a similar sigmoidal shape and limiting current; however, the response is often slower than that of the typical two-electrode setup. This leads to a broader voltammogram and a decreased wave slope, which can be somewhat misleading, causing the appearance that the process being studied is irreversible when it instead can be a result of the coupling of two reversible processes. We show that a large limiting current on the excess pole would facilitate the observation of a faster voltammetric response and that both redox concentration and electrode area of the excess pole affect the wave shape. Both factors should be maximized in electroanalytical experiments in order to obtain fast voltammetric responses on the main electrode of interest and to detect quick changes in analyte concentrations.","level1":["Energy","Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry"],"level2":["Electrochemical engineering","Electrochemical cells","Chemical reactions","Elements"],"level3":["Redox reactions","Platinum","Oxidation","Electrodes"],"levels":["Energy","Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic chemistry","Electrochemical engineering","Electrochemical cells","Chemical reactions","Elements","Redox reactions","Platinum","Oxidation","Electrodes"]},{"title":"Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Synthesis of AlFe-PILC-Supported MnCe Catalysts for Benzene Combustion","abstract":"An efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of AlFe-pillared clay (AlFe-PILC)-supported MnCe catalysts was explored.

Therefore, the biological function of S100A1 as a calcium signal transmitter is probably regulated by the redox potential within the cell. Systematic, structural studies of various mixed disulfides of S100A1 in the apo and holo states are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon. Using NMR methods we have determined the structure of apo-S100A1-\u03b2ME and, on the basis of 15N nuclear magnetic relaxation data, we have characterized the structural dynamics of both:\u2009 modified and unmodified molecules of apo-S100A1.

CusS is a membrane-associated histidine kinase with a periplasmic sensor domain connected to the cytoplasmic ATP binding and catalytic domains through two transmembrane helices. The mechanism of how CusS senses increasing metal ion concentrations and activates CusR is not yet known. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Ag(I)-bound periplasmic sensor domain of CusS at a resolution of 2.15 \u00c5.

Two symmetric metal binding sites are found at the dimeric interface, which are each formed by two histidines and one phenylalanine with an unusual cation\u2212\u03c0 interaction. The other metal ion binding sites are in a nonconserved region within each monomer. Functional analyses of CusS variants with mutations in the metal sites suggest that the metal ion binding site at the dimer interface is more important for function.

To clarify the origin of the switchover of the acid\u2212base catalysis, the reaction mechanism of the HCOOH dehydrogenation was studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was concluded from the DFT calculations together with the rate equation and experimentally determined activation energy that the bimolecular dehydrogenation proceeds between a strongly adsorbed bridging formate anion and a weakly adsorbed HCOOH molecule by cooperative catalysis of three adjacent surface Ti4+ ions as Lewis acidic sites on the surface. This mechanism is entirely different from the previous dehydration mechanism that the dehydration occurs on an oxygen point defect (basic character) formed in situ by H2O desorption from two OH under the catalytic dehydration reaction conditions.
