[{"title": "Evidence for the Superatom\u2013Superatom Bonding from Bond Energies", "abstract": "Metal clusters with specific number of valence electrons are described as superatoms. Super valence bond  model points out that superatoms could form the superatomic molecules through SVBs by sharing nucleus and electrons. The existence of superatom\u2013superatom bonding was verified by the shape of their orbitals in former studies. In this paper, another important evidence\u2014bond energy is studied as the criterion for the SVBs using the density functional theory method. In order to get the reliable values of bond energies, the series of Zn\u2013Cu and Mg\u2013Li superatomic molecules composed of two tetrahedral superatoms which do not share their nucleus are designed. Considering the number of the valence electrons in one tetrahedral superatomic unit, 2/2, 2/2, 2/2, and 2/2 clusters are 8e\u20138e, 7e\u20137e, 6e\u20136e, and 5e\u20135e binary superatomic molecules with super nonbond, single bond, double bond, and triple bond, respectively, which are verified by chemical bonding analysis depending on the SVB model. Further calculations reveal that the bond energies increase and the bond lengths decrease along with the bond orders in Zn\u2013Cu and Mg\u2013Li systems which is in accordance with the classical nonbond, single bond, double bond, and triple bond in C\u2013H systems. Thus, these values of bond energies confirm the existence of the SVBs. Moreover, electron localization function analysis is also carried on to describe the similarity between the superatomic bonds and atomic bonds in simple molecules directly. This study reveals the new evidence for the existence of the superatom\u2013superatom bonding depending on the bond energies, which gives the new insight for the further investigation of the superatomic clusters.", "level1": ["Energy", "Physical chemistry", "Inorganic chemistry"], "level2": ["Cluster chemistry", "Kinetics", "Binding energy", "Molecules", "Metals"], "level3": ["Metal clusters", "Kinetic parameters"], "levels": ["Energy", "Physical chemistry", "Inorganic chemistry", "Cluster chemistry", "Kinetics", "Binding energy", "Molecules", "Metals", "Metal clusters", "Kinetic parameters"]}, {"title": "Global Structure of a Three-Way Junction in a Phi29 Packaging RNA Dimer Determined Using Site-Directed Spin Labeling", "abstract": "The condensation of bacteriophage phi29 genomic DNA into its preformed procapsid requires the DNA packaging motor, which is the strongest known biological motor. The packaging motor is an intricate ring-shaped protein/RNA complex, and its function requires an RNA component called packaging RNA . Current structural information on pRNA is limited, which hinders studies of motor function. Here, we used site-directed spin labeling to map the conformation of a pRNA three-way junction that bridges binding sites for the motor ATPase and the procapsid. The studies were carried out on a pRNA dimer, which is the simplest ring-shaped pRNA complex and serves as a functional intermediate during motor assembly. Using a nucleotide-independent labeling scheme, stable nitroxide radicals were attached to eight specific pRNA sites without perturbing RNA folding and dimer formation, and a total of 17 internitroxide distances spanning the three-way junction were measured using Double Electron\u2013Electron Resonance spectroscopy. The measured distances, together with steric chemical constraints, were used to select 3662 viable three-way junction models from a pool of 65 billion. The results reveal a similar conformation among the viable models, with two of the helices  adopting an acute bend. This is in contrast to a recently reported pRNA tetramer crystal structure, in which HT and HL stack onto each other linearly.

Docking algorithms usually keep the protein rigid and only allow the ligand to be treated as flexible. However, a wrong assessment of the shape of the binding pocket can prevent a ligand from adapting a correct pose. Ensemble docking is a simple yet promising method to solve this problem: Ligands are docked into multiple structures, and the results are subsequently merged. Selection of protein structures is a significant factor for this approach. In this work we perform a comprehensive and comparative study evaluating the impact of structure selection on ensemble docking. We perform ensemble docking with several crystal structures and with structures derived from molecular dynamics simulations of renin, an attractive target for antihypertensive drugs. Here, 500 ns of MD simulations revealed binding site shapes not found in any available crystal structure. We evaluate the importance of structure selection for ensemble docking by comparing binding pose prediction, ability to rank actives above nonactives , and scoring accuracy. As a result, for ensemble definition k-means clustering appears to be better suited than hierarchical clustering with average linkage. The best performing ensemble consists of four crystal structures and is able to reproduce the native ligand poses better than any individual crystal structure. Moreover this ensemble outperforms 88% of all individual crystal structures in terms of screening utility as well as scoring accuracy.

Complex 1 is a unique example of an allyl\u2212Ni cationic complex with three different ligands and donor atoms. It has been fully characterized both in the solid state and in solution.

In the solid state, cation 1 exists as a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers 1a and 1b. In solution, complex 1 is involved in a slow fluxional process that causes the left-to-right exchange of syn and anti protons of the allyl group and leads to the interconversion of the two enantiomeric forms 1a and 1b.

Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization  mass spectrometry has shown some promise in the analysis of saturated hydrocarbons. However, APCI causes extensive fragmentation to these compounds, which impedes its effectiveness. To prevent this fragmentation, its causes were examined via gas-phase ion\u2013molecule reactions in vacuum in a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The results demonstrate that the mechanism proposed previously for ionization of saturated hydrocarbons upon APCI, hydride abstraction by carbocation reagent ions, is not correct. Instead, the fragmentation is caused by ionization of saturated hydrocarbons via exothermic proton-transfer reactions involving highly acidic, protonated atmospheric molecules, such as nitrogen and water.

The X-ray crystal structures of human and P. denitrificans ETFs are very similar. The hydroxyl hydrogen and a backbone amide hydrogen of T266 are hydrogen bonded to N and CO of the flavin, respectively, and the corresponding T244 has the same structural role in P. denitrificans ETF. We substituted a methionine for T244 in the  subunit of P. denitrificans ETF and expressed the mutant ETF in Escherichia coli.

The value of lifetime increases at the micromolar level of concentration of the Co ion, where the intensity increases and then remains practically unchanged as more salt is added to the system.

The frequency range of the BDS experiment is 40 Hz to 50 GHz, and the solution temperature is set at T  25.0 \u00b0C. Two relaxation processes originating from pullulan and water molecules are obtained in the megahertz and gigahertz regions, respectively. Additionally, the electrode polarization and the contribution of dc conductivity are also observed at lower frequencies. The relaxation process at a frequency higher than 10 GHz is associated with the primary process of water , and that at 100 MHz is attributed to the local chain motion of pullulan . Impurities in the aqueous solutions, which are practically disregarded in the analysis of polysaccharide solutions, affect the quality of the relaxation spectrum. Thus, the purification of pullulan sample is carried out by methanol precipitation from aqueous pullulan solution. This iterative purification reduces the contributions of electrode polarization and DC conductivity, which enables the clear observation of the relaxation of the m-process. It was found that the relaxation times of the m- and h-processes increase with pullulan concentration. The relaxation strength of the m-process shows increasing behavior with increasing pullulan concentration, whereas the relaxation strength of the h-process decreases with increasing pullulan concentration. It is suggested that the relaxation strength of the m-process is mainly determined by the magnitude of the dipole moment of solvent molecules. The relaxation process of water  is affected by the interactions of pullulan chains.

The structures are polytypes of calcite, differing in the stacking sequence of close-packed  Ca layers. The two- and six-layered polytypes have hexagonal symmetry P6322 and were named hexarag and hexite, respectively. Hexarag is similar to aragonite, but with all the triangles placed on the middle distance between the cp layers. On the basis of the structures found, a two-step mechanism for the transformation of aragonite to calcite is suggested. In the first step, CO3 triangles migrate to halfway between the Ca layers with the formation of hexarag. In the second step, the two-layered cp  hexarag structure transforms into three-layered cp  calcite through a series of many-layered polytypes. The topotactic character of the transformation of aragonite to calcite, with  of aragonite being parallel to  of calcite, is consistent with the suggested mechanism.

To assess the possibility of the formation of the polytypes found in nature or experiments, a TEM analysis of ground aragonite was performed. A grain was found that had six superstructure reflections in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the cp layer.

A previous theoretical investigation reported the following mechanism for the reaction:  metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of the alcohol into an aldehyde,  metal\u2013ligand cooperation  addition of water to 1-Ru to give an octahedral ruthenium hydroxide ,  concerted MLC hydration of the aldehyde by 2-Ru\u2013OH to give separated 1-Ru and a gem-diol, and  concerted MLC dehydrogenation of the gem-diol by 1-Ru into an octahedral ruthenium dihydride  and a carboxylic acid. We calculate the outer-sphere PES in the reaction between the aldehyde and 2-Ru\u2013OH to start with a localized coupling step yielding an ion-pair minimum  in which the hydroxyl group of an -hydroxyl-alkoxide  is coordinated to the metal of a cationic square-pyramidal complex. From 7-ip-OH, we identify a route to carboxylic acid that circumvents ligand deprotonation involving  1,1-rearrangement of the gem-diolate within the contact ion pair through an -OH/O\u2013 slippage TS into the octahedral 2-Ru\u2013OCHR and  a second 1,1-rearrangement through an -O\u2013/H slippage TS that gives a new ion-pair minimum in which the -hydrogen of the anion is coordinated to the metal, followed by a localized hydride-transfer TS that gives a carboxylic acid and the octahedral hydride complex . The net transformation from 2-Ru\u2013OH and the aldehyde to the carboxylic acid and 2-Ru\u2013H can be viewed as a H/OH metathesis in which a hydride and a hydroxide are exchanged between the acyl group of the aldehyde and the metal center of 2-Ru\u2013OH. The MLC mechanism gives the same metathesis products through the intermediacy of a gem-diol. When the SMD solvent continuum model is applied during geometry optimization with water as the solvent, the Gibbs free energy profile of the slippage pathway is predicted to be much lower than that predicted for MLC.

A lattice model adequately accounts for the population of each type of diluent. The diluent in contact with other diluent considered to be a microcluster undergoes isotropic Brownian rotational diffusion with an apparent activation energy of 56 kJ/mol. The isolated diluent molecules undergo Brownian rotation restricted to a cone, and the rate and amplitude of this motion increase slowly with temperature. The temperature and breadth of the mechanical loss peak at a frequency of 1 Hz associated with rotation of the diluent in microclusters can be calculated from the interpretation of the line shape data.

Although the sensitivity to the local environment is reduced compared to that of Py, attaching C4 and C8 at the 2-position of Py can provide a possible means to probe the local hydrophobicity in different parts of the tail region. The absence of excimer fluorescence and the ratio of the vibronic fluorescence peak intensities  in a lipid environment indicate the existence of Py as monomers in the hydrophobic region, similar to hydrophobic solvation, yet close to the headgroup region. When Py is replaced by Py-C4 and Py-C8, there is a small increase in hydrophobicity  as the Py moiety is pulled deeper inside the tail region of both cubic and lamellar phases. The larger space of the tail region in the lamellar phase is reflected as more local hydrophobicity measured by the probes which can penetrate deep inside, whereas the curved structure of the cubic phase limits the available space for the probes. Three fluorescence lifetime components were measured in lipid, indicating the heterogeneous nature of the hydrophobic region. In the lamellar phase, a large reduction in the average lifetime value, led by the long decay component, was measured for Py-C4  and Py-C8  compared to that of the parent Py. This observation suggests the presence of a mechanism of interaction more collisional than static between the Py moiety and the tail region of the bilayer unit due to the ample space provided by the lamellar phase as the probe is buried deeper inside the hydrophobic region.

A rheo-optical study which includes measurements of dichroism, birefringence, and turbidity under flow at various shear rates is also discussed. The shear viscosity data in steady shear agree with the complex viscosity in the limit of low deformation rates. For moderate deformation rates, in the shear thinning region, the Cox-Merz rule is not followed. In all cases, a limiting stress or plateau stress was observed at shear rates that exceed one-half of the reciprocal of the main relaxation time . At the stress plateau, the micellar solution most likely undergoes an isotropic-to-nematic phase transition induced by shear. However, our results do not conclusively exclude the possibility of a constitutive instability with respect to shear banding, in which simultaneous shear rates coexist under controlled stress experiments. In unsteady shear flow, CTAT\u2212water micellar solutions exhibit a slow transient behavior in which the system achieves steady state in starting up experiments after tens to hundreds of Maxwell relaxation times. This is consistent with the existence of shear banding. Metastable branches are also observed in thixotropic loops produced under exponential shear. The time scale of this branch coincides with that of the inception of shear flow just before the overshoot peak. Moreover, the system exhibits a quasilinear rheological behavior at long times characterized by an exponential relaxation with a single time constant. A simple model consisting of the co-deformational Maxwell constitutive equation and a kinetic equation for construction and destruction of structure is proposed to predict distinct features of the complex rheological behavior of the elongated micellar solutions.

In these mutants, the bidentate glutamic acid  residue which coordinates Ca2 at the \u2212Z position in each site has been mutated to a glutamine , preventing Ca2 binding at that site. The results demonstrate that Ca2 binding at site I of CaM is critical for all electron transfer reactions.

The site III CaM mutant  activated nNOS to levels similar to activities measured with wild-type CaM.

In contrast to previously developed molecular builders such as POLYS  where only information about the minimum energy conformation of disaccharide pairs is considered in order to build larger oligosaccharides, this tool is based on a systematic search of dihedral conformational space, optimization of structures using implicit solvation models, explicit molecular dynamics simulations, NOE calculations, and a very powerful substructure recognition algorithm and database. Our FSPS can rapidly find minimum-energy conformers and rank them according to different criteria. Two such criteria are the energy of the conformers in implicit solvent and the root-mean-square deviation  of computed NOEs with respect to experimental data. Even though experimental NOEs may result from an average over conformers instead of a single structure, we find that sorting according to NOE RMSD constitutes a better estimator for the global free-energy minimum structure in explicit solvent . In contrast, the lowest-energy structure in implicit solvent does not usually correspond to the free-energy minimum. A harmonic approximation to compute free energies of each conformer does not appear to reverse this conclusion, indicating that either explicit hydrogen bonding to the solvent or anharmonic effects in the free energy or both are fundamentally important.

Both enzymes are members of the aldo\u2212keto reductase  superfamily and possess catalytic tetrads differing by a single amino acid. In 3-HSD, the tetrad consists of Tyr55, Lys84, Asp50, and His117, but a glutamic acid replaces His117 in 5-reductase. By introducing the H117E point mutation into 3-HSD, we engineered 5-reductase activity into the dehydrogenase. Homogeneous H117E 3-HSD reduced the double bond in testosterone to form 5-dihydrotestosterone with kcat  0.25 min-1 and Km  19.0 M and reduced the double bond in progesterone to generate 5-dihydroprogesterone with kcat  0.97 min-1 and Km  33.0 M. These kinetic parameters were similar to those reported for homogeneous rat liver 5-reductase . The H117E mutant also reduced 5-dihydrosteroids to 5,3-tetrahydrosteroids with a 600\u22121000-fold decrease in kcat/Km versus wild-type 3-HSD. The ratio of 5-reductase:3-HSD activity in the H117E mutant was approximately 1:1. Although the H117A mutant reduced \u03944-3-ketosteroids, the 3-HSD activity predominated because the 5-dihydrosteroids were rapidly converted to the 5,3-tetrahydrosteroids. The pH\u2212rate profiles for carbon\u2212carbon double-bond and ketone reduction catalyzed by the H117E mutant were superimposable, suggesting a common titratable group  for both reactions. In wild-type 3-HSD, the titratable group responsible for 3-ketosteroid reduction has a pKb  6.9 and is assignable to Tyr55. The pH\u2212rate profiles for 3-ketosteroid reduction by the H117A mutant were pH-independent. Our data indicate that Tyr55 functions as a general acid for both 3-HSD and 5-reductase activities. We suggest that a protonated Glu117 increases the acidity of Tyr55 to promote acid-catalyzed enolization of the \u03944-3-ketosteroid substrate. Further, the identity of amino acid 117 determines whether an AKR can function as a 5-reductase by reorienting the substrate relative to the nicotinamide cofactor.

Consequently, the variational calculations using the KP theory can be efficiently carried out beyond the first order, i.e., the Giachetti-Tognetti-Feynman-Kleinert variational approach, for realistic chemical applications. By making use of the approximation of independent instantaneous normal modes , the AIF-PI method can be applied to many-body systems, and it was shown previously that the AIF-PI method is accurate for computing the quantum effects including a water molecule and the collinear H3 reaction. In this work, the accuracy and properties of the KP theory are further investigated by using the first three-order perturbations on an asymmetric double-well potential, the bond vibrations of H2, HF, and HCl represented by the Morse potential, and a proton-transfer barrier modeled by the Eckart potential. The zero-point energy, quantum partition function, and tunneling factor for these systems have been determined and are found to be in excellent agreement with the exact quantum results. Using our new analytical results at the zero-temperature limit, we show that the minimum value of the computed centroid potential in the KP theory is in excellent agreement with the ground-state energy , and the position of the centroid potential minimum is the expectation value of particle position in wave mechanics.

Most reported SERS hotspots have been shown to exist in zero-dimensional point-like, one-dimensional linear, or two-dimensional planar geometries. Here, we demonstrate a novel three-dimensional  hotspot matrix that can hold hotspots between every two adjacent particles in 3D space, simply achieved by evaporating a droplet of citrate-Ag sols on a fluorosilylated silicon wafer. In situ synchrotron-radiation small-angle X-ray scattering , combined with dark-field microscopy and in situ micro-UV, was employed to explore the evolution of the 3D geometry and plasmonic properties of Ag nanoparticles in a single droplet. In such a droplet, there is a distinct 3D geometry with minimal polydispersity of particle size and maximal uniformity of interparticle distance, significantly different from the dry state. According to theoretical simulations, the liquid adhesive force promotes a closely packed assembly of particles, and the interparticle distance is not fixed but can be balanced in a small range by the interplay of the van der Waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion experienced by a particle. The \u201ctrapping well\u201d for immobilizing particles in 3D space can result in a large number of hotspots in a 3D geometry. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the 3D hotspots are predictable and time-ordered in the absence of any sample manipulation. Use of the matrix not only produces giant Raman enhancement at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of dried substrates, but also provides the structural basis for trapping molecules. Even a single molecule of resonant dye can generate a large SERS signal. With a portable Raman spectrometer, the detection capability is also greatly improved for various analytes with different natures, including pesticides and drugs.

Cv. Cabernet Sauvignon Grape Berries", "abstract": "The influence of irrigation strategy on grape berry carotenoids and C13-norisoprenoid precursors was investigated for Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon. Two irrigation treatments were compared, one in which vines received reduced irrigation applied alternately to either side of the vine  and a second control treatment in which water was applied to both sides of the vine. Over the two years of the experiments, PRD vines received on average 66% of the water applied to the controls. Initially, the PRD treatment did not alter midday leaf  and stem  water potential relative to the control, but decreased stomatal conductance . Continued exposure to the PRD treatment resulted in treated grapevines experiencing hydraulic water deficit relative to the control treatment and induced lowered midday L and S, which was also reflected in decreased berry weight at harvest. In both irrigation treatments, the most abundant grape berry carotenoids, -carotene and lutein, followed the developmental pattern typical of other grape varieties, decreasing post-veraison. At certain points in time, as the fruit approached maturity, the concentration of these carotenoids was increased in fruit of PRD-treated vines relative to the controls. This effect was greater for lutein than for -carotene. PRD consistently caused increases in the concentration of hydrolytically released C13-norisoprenoids -damascenone, -ionone, and 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene in fruit at harvest  over two seasons. The effect of the PRD treatment on the concentration of hydrolytically released C13-norisoprenoids was greater in the second of the two seasons of the experiment and was also reflected in an increase in total C13-norisoprenoid content per berry. This suggests that the increases in the concentration of the C13-norisoprenoids in response to PRD were independent of water deficit induced changes in berry size and were not the result of an altered berry surface area to volume ratio.

Although a variety of energetically similar conformers could be anticipated, it is extremely difficult to predict the crystal conformation for conformationally flexible molecules. The present study investigates differences in thermodynamic parameters for the free base, c-FB, and an amorphous dihydrochloride salt, a-Di-HCl, of a conformationally flexible drug substance, tenapanor . A variety of complementary techniques such as, thermal analysis, powder X-ray diffraction , and molecular modeling were used to assess the thermodynamic properties and the propensity of crystallization for a-FB and a-Di-HCl, tenapanor. Molecular modeling and total scattering measurements suggested that the a-Di-HCl salt exists in an open elongated state with local 1D stacking, which extends only to the first nearest neighbor, while the a-FB shows local stacking extending to the third nearest neighbor. The overall relaxation behavior, which typically is an indicator for physical stability, as measured by modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry and PXRD suggested a nontypical dual relaxation process for the dihydrochloride salt form. The first relaxation was fast and occurred on warming from the quench conditions without any thermal annealing, while the second relaxation step followed a more traditional glass relaxation model, exhibiting an infinite relaxation time. Similar analysis for the a-FB suggested a comparatively shorter relaxation time  that results in its rapid crystallization.
