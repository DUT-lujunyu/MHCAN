In such a geometry, the field experiences no refractive index gradients, yet it acquires a transversely modulated Pancharatnam\u2013Berry phase, that is, a geometric phase originating from a spin\u2013orbit interaction. We show that the periodic evolution of the geometric phase versus propagation gives rise to a longitudinally invariant effective potential. In certain configurations, this geometric phase can provide transverse confinement and waveguiding. The theoretical findings are tested and validated against numerical simulations of the complete Maxwell\u2019s equations. Our results introduce and illustrate the role of geometric phases on electromagnetic propagation over distances well exceeding the diffraction length, paving the way to a whole new family of guided waves and waveguides that do not rely on refractive index tailoring."},{"title":"External Electric Fields Interrupt the Concerted Cope Rearrangement of Semibullvalene","abstract":"The topic of this paper is whether the mechanism of the degenerate Cope rearrangement of semibullvalene can be affected by the presence of electrostatic fields. Herein, we report that the shape of the energy surface, as demonstrated by an \u201cinterrupted\u201d (stepwise) mechanism, is altered in the presence of a copper cation, Cu+. Natural bond-orbital and block-localized wave-function energy decomposition analyses suggest that orbital and electrostatic interactions play a major role in altering the shape of the energy surface. Applying additional external electric fields (EEFs) induces a significant change to the energy surface with Cu+ present but negligible effects in the absence of Cu+. These findings are consistent with recent studies that demonstrate that EEFs more readily stabilize\/destabilize systems with larger, more polarizable, dipole moments."},{"title":"Competitive Sorption between Imidacloprid and Imidacloprid-urea on Soil Clay Minerals and Humic Acids","abstract":"Soil organic matter and clay minerals are responsible for the adsorption of many pesticides. Adsorption and competitive sorption of imidacloprid on clay minerals and humic acids (HA) were determined using the batch equilibration method. The sorption coefficient of imidacloprid on humic acids was significantly higher than that on Ca-clay minerals, indicating that soil organic matter content was a more important property in influencing the adsorption of imidacloprid. Competitive sorption was investigated between imidacloprid and its main metabolite imidacloprid-urea on HA and Ca-clay minerals. The results showed that the sorption capacity of imidacloprid on clay minerals and HA was reduced in the presence of the metabolite, implying that imidacloprid-urea could occupy or block adsorption sites of imidacloprid on soil, potentially affecting the fate, transport, and bioavailability of imidacloprid in the environment. The interactions between a Ca-clay or HA-clay mixture and adsorption of imidacloprid and imidacloprid-urea were studied using IR differential spectra on thin films made of the adsorbent. The possible mechanisms were discussed from the shift of characteristic IR absorption bands of imidacloprid and imidacloprid-urea after sorption.

Cyclic voltammetry in aqueous media ([H+] = 0.1 and 1.0 M in LiNO3\/LiClO4\/CF3SO3Li) shows a single wave (\u0394Ep = 58 mV). With the gradual addition of LiCl\/Li2SO4, this wave is shifted cathodically. Simultaneously, the value of \u0394Ep also gradually decreases from 58 to 37 mV in 1.0 M chloride and to 42 mV in 0.75 M sulfate media. Similar trends are also noticed in linear dc voltammograms.

In nitromethane, the redox process is complicated by adsorption. Because of the very small difference in redox potentials, the selective oxidation of one of the Ni(II) centers to form a mixed-valent Ni(II)\u2212Ni(III) species is not practical. However, during reductive decomposition of the bis-Ni(III) species, a mixed-valent species could be identified. In stopped flow kinetics experiments, the UV\u2212visible spectrum of a transient Ni(II)\u2212Ni(III) intermediate in acetonitrile has been elucidated by one-electron reduction of the bis-Ni(III) species with [NiII(9-aneN3)2]2+ (9-aneN3 = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane). The differences in the redox behavior in various media are explained in terms of electrostatic interactions between the adjacent nickel centers influenced by sterically controlled axial ligation of counterions and solvents.

Isolation of dimeric [NiII(SN4(tren)-RSdang)]2 (\u201cdang\u201d= dangling, uncoordinated thiolate supported by H bonds), using the less bulky [(tren)N4S]1- ligand, pointed to the need for gem-dimethyls adjacent to the sulfur to sterically prevent dimerization. All of the gem-dimethyl derivatized complexes are monomeric and, with the exception of [NiII(SMe2N4(tren)]+, are isostructural and adopt a tetragonally distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry favored by ligand constraints. The nickel complex uniquely adopts an approximately ideal square pyramidal geometry and resembles the active site of Ni-superoxide dismutase (Ni-SOD). Even in coordinating solvents such as MeCN, only five-coordinate structures are observed.

As the d-orbitals drop in energy proceeding across the across the series M2+ (M= Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), the sulfur-to-metal charge-transfer transition moves into the visible region, and the redox potentials cathodically shift.

Hexadecane and palmitic acid were used as the base oil and typical fatty acid, respectively. A Cu-coated silicon wafer was prepared as the target substrate. The solvation structure formed by hexadecane molecules at the interface between the Cu substrate and the hexadecane was observed, and the layer pitch was found to be about 0.6 nm, which corresponds to the height of hexadecane molecules. This demonstrates that hexadecane molecules physically adsorbed onto the surface due to van der Waals forces with lying orientation because hexadecane is a nonpolar hydrocarbon. When hexadecane with palmitic acid was put on the Cu substrate instead of pure hexadecane, an adsorption layer of palmitic acid was observed at the interface. The layer pitch was about 2.5\u20132.8 nm, which matches the chain length of palmitic acid molecules well. This indicates that the original adsorption layer was monolayer or single bilayer in the local area. In addition, a cross-sectional image captured 1 h after observation started to reveal that the adsorbed additive layer gradually grew up to be thicker than about 20 nm due to an external stimulus, such as cantilever oscillation. This is the first report of in situ observation of an adsorbed layer by FM-AFM in the tribology field and demonstrates that FM-AFM is useful for clarifying the actual boundary lubrication mechanism."},{"title":"Spectroscopy of Lithium Atoms and Molecules on Helium Nanodroplets","abstract":"We report on the spectroscopic investigation of lithium atoms and lithium dimers in their triplet manifold on the surface of helium nanodroplets (HeN). We present the excitation spectrum of the 3p \u2190 2s and 3d \u2190 2s two-photon transitions for single Li atoms on HeN. The atoms are excited from the 2S(\u03a3) ground state into \u0394, \u03a0, and \u03a3 pseudodiatomic molecular substates. Excitation spectra are recorded by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization time-of-flight (REMPI-TOF) mass spectroscopy, which allows an investigation of the exciplex (Li*\u2013Hem, m = 1\u20133) formation process in the Li\u2013HeN system. Electronic states are shifted and broadened with respect to free atom states, which is explained within the pseudodiatomic model. The assignment is assisted by theoretical calculations, which are based on the Orsay\u2013Trento density functional where the interaction between the helium droplet and the lithium atom is introduced by a pairwise additive approach. When a droplet is doped with more than one alkali atom, the fragility of the alkali\u2013HeN systems leads preferably to the formation of high-spin molecules on the droplets. We use this property of helium nanodroplets for the preparation of Li dimers in their triplet ground state (13\u03a3u+).

The interaction between the molecule and the droplet manifests in a broadening of the transitions with a characteristic asymmetric form. The broadening extends to the blue side of each vibronic level, which is caused by the simultaneous excitation of the molecule and vibrations of the droplet (phonons). The two isotopes of Li form 6Li2 and 7Li2 as well as isotope mixed 6Li7Li molecules on the droplet surface.

DLS study showed that the addition of NaSal leads to a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient of the whole micelle indicating micellar growth. QENS data analysis suggested that observed dynamics involves two distinct motions, lateral motion of the surfactant over the curved micellar surface and localized segmental motion of the surfactant. It is found that the addition of NaSal slows down the lateral motion of DTAB while the localized segmental motion of the DTAB chain is not affected much. An atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to gain further insight into the underlying phenomena. MD simulation results are found to be consistent with the experimental observations. MD simulation revealed that location of the salicylate ions on the micellar surface and their strong electrostatic association with their oppositely charged surfactant headgroup are the major factors in slowing down the lateral motion of the DTAB molecule. In the present work, a quantitative description of the effects of NaSal on the nanoscopic dynamics of DTAB micelles and its correlation with the microstructure of the micelle is provided."},{"title":"Restricted Surface Mobility of Thiolate-Covered Metal Surfaces:\u2009 A Simple Strategy to Produce High-Area Functionalized Surfaces","abstract":"We have studied the self-assembly of thiol monolayers on high-area nanostructured gold surfaces. These surfaces are highly irregular with a fractal dimension close to 2.5. Auger electron spectroscopy and voltammetric data indicate that thiol self-assembly with a maximum surface coverage \u2248 1\/3 takes place, the same result as that found for smooth gold surfaces. Therefore, neither curvature effects, which would promote higher coverage, nor excluded volume effects, which would result in lower coverage, are present in these irregular surfaces. The high surface area of the bare electrodes exhibits a rapid surface decay in different liquid media that is hindered by alkanethiolate chemisorption. The presence of thiolate SAMs reduces markedly the mass transport surface diffusion of gold adatoms, hindering surface area decay and freezing the system in a metastable state for days. This effect cannot be explained by considering only hydrocarbon\u2212hydrocarbon chain interactions, because it is also observed for ordered arrays of adsorbed S atoms. Therefore, interactions between ordered chemisorbed species at high coverage seem to be responsible for the observed behavior. The thiol-covered high-area metallic substrates can be used to efficiently anchor a large number of molecules, biomolecules, or nanostructures, improving the performance of SAM-based optical and electrochemical devices.

An understanding of the structure of the whole protein is often vital to understanding its digestive behavior in animals and nutritive quality. Usually protein secondary structures include \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet. The percentages of these two structures in protein secondary structures may influence feed protein quality and digestive behavior. Feathers are widely available as a potential protein supplement. They are very high in protein (84%), but the digestibility of the protein is very low (5%). The objective of this study was to use synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy to reveal chemical features of feather protein secondary structure within amide I at ultraspatial resolution (pixel size = 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm), in comparison with other protein sources from easily digested feeds such as barley, oat, and wheat tissue at endosperm regions (without destruction of their inherent structure). This experiment was performed at beamline U2B of the Albert Einstein Center for Synchrotron Biosciences at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) in Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), U.S. Dept of Energy (NSLS-BNL, Upton, NY). The results showed that ultraspatially resolved chemical imaging of feed protein secondary structure in terms of \u03b2-sheet to \u03b1-helix peak height ratio by stepping in pixel-sized increments was obtained. Using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy can distinguish structures of protein amide I among the different feed protein sources. The results show that the secondary structure of feather protein differed from those of other feed protein sources in terms of the line-shape and position of amide I. The feather protein amide I peaked at \u223c1630 cm-1. However, other feed protein sources showed a peak at \u223c1650 cm-1. By using multicomponent peak modeling, the relatively quantitative amounts of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet in protein secondary structure were obtained, which showed that feather contains 88% \u03b2-sheet and 4% \u03b1-helix, barley contains 17% \u03b2-sheet and 71% \u03b1-helix, oat contains 2% \u03b2-sheet and 92% \u03b1-helix, and wheat contains 42% \u03b2-sheet and 50% \u03b1-helix. The difference in percentage of protein secondary structure may be part of the reason for different feed protein digestive behaviors. These results demonstrate the potential of highly spatially resolved infrared microspectroscopy to reveal feed protein secondary structure. Information from this study by the infrared probing of feed protein secondary structure may be valuable as a guide for feed breeders to improve and maintain protein quality for animal use.

The conventional solutions to circumvent this problem are size control of nanoparticles or increasing the vascular permeability. The aim of this study is to investigate the combination effect of size variation of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles and improved vascular permeability triggered by near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Doxorubicin (DOX), a clinically proven drug for bladder cancer, was encapsulated in the nanocomposites with high loading content up to 45%. We show that NIR light-responsive size-switchable nanocarriers could considerably enhance the tumor-targeting of DOX in bladder tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, a combination of NIR-induced hyperthermia and DOX-mediated chemotherapy resulted in remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in mice. Histological results suggest that the change in morphology of tumor microvasculature may account for enhanced extravasation and accumulation of the nanodrugs upon NIR irradiation.

In this paper, we present junction resistance measurements of individual silver nanowire junctions, producing for the first time a distribution of junction resistance values and conclusively demonstrating that the junction contribution to the overall resistance can be reduced beyond that of the wires through standard processing techniques. We find that this distribution shows the presence of a small percentage (6%) of high-resistance junctions, and we show how these may impact the performance of network-based materials. Finally, through combining experiment with a rigorous model, we demonstrate the important role played by the network skeleton and the specific connectivity of the network in determining network performance."},{"title":"Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Properties of Rosemary and Sage (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis<\/i> L. and <i>Salvia officinalis<\/i> L., Lamiaceae) Essential Oils","abstract":"The essential oils of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and sage (Salvia officinalis L.) were analyzed by means of gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and assayed for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.

The mixture used for the research testing was prepared with a high water content (H2O\/C2H5OH = 8.4 mol\/mol) in order to simulate the composition of the ecological fuel product from vegetable biomass fermentation. The experimental tests were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at a programmed temperature between 323 and 923 K. The maximum temperature (T = 923 K) is the standard working temperature of a molten carbonate fuel cell able to make direct use of the hydrogen produced for ethanol steam reforming. The reaction mechanism starts with the initial dehydrogenation and\/or dehydration of the ethanol, followed by rapid conversion of the products into methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The acid support (Al2O3) assists the dehydration of the alcohol, while all the other reactions are catalyzed by the Rh, although in different measures. For this reason, with increase in Rh content, there is also a progressive increase in the C1 (CH4, CO, and CO2), while the C2 (ethylene, ethanol, and acetaldehyde) disappear gradually from the outlet gaseous stream. The acetaldehyde, that is produced by dehydrogenation, is formed during an intermediate stage, but rapidly decomposes to CH4 and CO when working at high temperatures. Traces of acetaldehyde and hydrogen in a ratio of 1:1 are also present in the reaction products when pure Al2O3 is used. However in this case the main product of the reaction is the ethylene obtained by dehydration on the acid sites of the Al2O3. Obviously the presence of the ethylene assists the formation of carbon whiskers very strongly, which after only a few hours can be easily seen on the depleted catalyst. Vice versa, in the presence of Rh at high temperatures (T = 923 K), coking does not occur and the catalyst maintains its activity for several hours transforming all the ethanol into C1 and H2.

To liberate the thiol groups, the intact IgG was split into two half-IgG fragments without destruction of the binding site of the antibody. The immobilization of half-IgG fragments on the gold surface was carried out by simple adsorption. The antigen binding capacity of the half-IgG modified gold supports is similar to that of the gold surfaces with the traditionally linked antibodies and is much higher than for nonspecifically adsorbed intact IgGs. The immobilized antibodies, according to the proposed approach, maintain high antigen binding constants. The immobilization procedure provides orientation of IgG fragments in terms of the similar distance between the binding site of the antibody and the surface of the gold support, which does not cause the distribution of the apparent affinity constants. The high operational stability of half-IgG modified gold electrodes makes them applicable for analytical applications.

In this work, we designed a three-dimensional (3D) DNA walker nanoprobe for A\u03b2O detection and real-time imaging in living cells and in vivo. The presence of A\u03b2O triggered the DNAzyme walking strand to cleave the fluorophore (TAMRA)-labeled substrate strand modified on the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface and release TAMRA-labeled DNA fragment, resulting in the recovery of fluorescent signal. The entire process was autonomous and continuous, without external fuel strands or protease, and finally produced plenty of TAMRA fluorescence, achieving signal amplification effect. The nanoprobe enabled the quantitative detection of A\u03b2O in vitro, and the limit of detection was 22.3 pM. Given the good biocompatibility of 3D DNA walker nanoprobe, we extended this enzyme-free signal amplification method to real-time imaging of A\u03b2O. Under the microscope, nanoprobe accurately located and visualized the distribution of A\u03b2O in living cells. Moreover, in vivo imaging results showed that our nanoprobe could be used to effectively distinguish the AD mice from the wild-type mice. This nanoprobe with the advantages of great sensitivity, high specificity, and convenience, provides an outstanding prospect for AD\u2019s early diagnosis development."},{"title":"Online Stable Isotope Analysis of Dissolved Organic Carbon Size Classes Using Size Exclusion Chromatography Coupled to an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer","abstract":"Stable isotopic content of dissolved organic carbon (\u03b413C-DOC) provides valuable information on its origin and fate. In an attempt to get additional insights into DOC cycling, we developed a method for \u03b413C measurement of DOC size classes by coupling high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\u2013size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to online isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). This represents a significant methodological contribution to DOC research. The interface was evaluated using various organic compounds, thoroughly tested with soil\u2013water from a C3\u2013C4 vegetation change experiment, and also applied to riverine and marine DOC. \u03b413C analysis of standard compounds resulted in excellent analytical precision (\u22640.3\u2030). Chromatography resolved soil DOC into 3 fractions: high molecular weight (HMW; 0.4\u201310 kDa), low molecular weight (LMW; 50\u2013400 Da), and retained (R) fraction. Sample reproducibility for measurement of \u03b413C-DOC size classes was \u00b10.25\u2030 for HMW fraction, \u00b1 0.54\u2030 for LMW fraction, and \u00b11.3\u2030 for R fraction. The greater variance in \u03b413C values of the latter fractions was due to their lower concentrations. The limit of quantification (SD \u22640.6\u2030) for each size fraction measured as a peak is 200 ng C (2 mg C\/L). \u03b413C-DOC values obtained in SEC mode correlated significantly with those obtained without column in the \u03bcEA mode (p &lt; 0.001, intercept 0.17\u2030), which rules out SEC-associated isotopic effects or DOC loss. In the vegetation change experiment, fractions revealed a clear trend in plant contribution to DOC; those in deeper soils and smaller size fractions had less plant material. It was also demonstrated that the technique can be successfully applied to marine and riverine DOC without further sample pretreatment."},{"title":"Effect of Solution Chemistry on the Extent of Binding of Phenanthrene by a Soil Humic Acid:\u2009 A Comparison of Dissolved and Clay Bound Humic","abstract":"The effect of pH, ionic strength, and cation in solution on the binding of phenanthrene by a soil humic acid in the aqueous phase was determined using fluorescence quenching. The phenanthrene binding coefficient with the dissolved soil humic, Koc, decreased with increasing ionic strength and solution cation valence. At low values of ionic strength, Koc values for this soil humic acid increased with increasing pH. For this humic sample, the experimental results were consistent with a conformational model of the humic substance in aqueous solution where, depending on solution conditions, some parts of the humic structure may be more open to allow increased PAH access to attachment sites. After sorption onto clays, supernatant solutions of the unadsorbed humic fraction yielded lower Koc values than the original bulk humic acid, suggesting that the humic substance was fractionating during its sorption onto the clays. Additionally, the extent of phenanthrene binding with the adsorbed humic fraction was lower than the results determined for the bulk humic acid prior to adsorption. The conformation of the humic substance when sorbed onto the inorganic surface appears to be affecting the level of phenanthrene binding by the humic acid.

However, the effects of self-clustering of HOCs on their environmental behavior and toxicology have not yet received enough attention. With the use of a recently developed technique, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, the motion and distribution of perylene nanoclusters (PNCs) formed in water at very low concentration (1 \u03bcM) were visualized with high temporal and spatial resolution. The liquid\u2013solid interface process of PNCs adsorbing onto graphene was also recorded. Instead of the traditional view of HOC adsorption as a single molecule, our study revealed the characteristic of irreversible adsorption of perylene onto the carbonaceous surface in the form of nanoclusters, exhibiting random sequential \u201ccar-parking\u201d events. More interestingly, the transport of PNCs across the cell membrane was also captured in real time, demonstrating that they entered macrophage cells by endocytosis. Supplementing the well-recognized routine of passive diffusion through a membrane lipid bilayer, the uptake of HOCs in the form of nanoclusters by endocytosis is proposed to be an additional but important mechanism for their uptake into living cells. The distribution of HOCs in environmental systems in the form of nanoclusters, exemplified by PNCs in this study, may have significant implications for understanding their environmental fate and potential toxicological effects."},{"title":"Characterization of the Initial Stages of SBA-15 Synthesis by in Situ Time-Resolved Small-Angle X-ray Scattering","abstract":"The initial stages of SBA-15 synthesis have been studied by using in situ time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering with a synchrotron radiation source. The quantitative analysis of X-ray scattering and diffraction intensities allows the structures of intermediates to be identified at the different stages of SBA-15 synthesis. Following tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) addition, an intense small-angle scattering and an associated secondary maximum are observed, which are attributed to non-interacting surfactant template micelles encrusted with silicate species. After 25\u221230 min of the reaction, the broad scattering disappears and narrow Bragg diffraction peaks typical of hexagonally ordered structure are observed. The cylindrical micelles identified from X-ray scattering data appear to be the direct precursors of 2D hexagonal SBA-15 structure. Just after the formation of the SBA-15 hexagonal phase, the cylindrical micelles are only weakly linked in the hexagonal structure. As the synthesis proceeds, the solvent in the void volume between the cylindrical micelles is gradually replaced by more dense silicate species. The unit cell parameter of SBA-15 is progressively decreasing during the SBA-15 synthesis, which can be related to the condensation and densification of silicate fragments in the spaces between the cylinders. The volume fraction of the 2D hexagonally ordered phase is sharply growing during the first 2 h of the reaction. The inner core radius of SBA-15 material remains almost constant during the whole synthesis and is principally affected by the size of the poly(propylene oxide) inner core in the original cylindrical micelles.

Taujale and H. Zhang, \u201cImpact of interactions between metal oxides to oxidative reactivity of manganese dioxide\u201d Environ. Sci. Technol.2012, 46, 2764\u20132771). The aim of the current work was to investigate interactions in ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al2O3, and NOM and how the interactions affect MnO2 oxidative reactivity. For the effect of Al ions, we examined ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al ions, and NOM. Our results indicated that an increase in the amount of humic acids (HAs) increasingly inhibited Al adsorption by forming soluble Al\u2013HA complexes. As a consequence, there was less inhibition on MnO2 reactivity than by the sum of two binary mixtures (MnO2+Al ions and MnO2+HA). Alginate or pyromellitic acid (PA)\u2014two model NOM compounds\u2014did not affect Al adsorption, but Al ions increased alginate\/PA adsorption by MnO2. The latter effect led to more inhibition on MnO2 reactivity than the sum of the two binary mixtures. In ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al2O3, and NOM, NOM inhibited dissolution of Al2O3. Zeta potential measurements, sedimentation experiments, TEM images, and modified DLVO calculations all indicated that HAs of up to 4 mg-C\/L increased heteroaggregation between Al2O3 and MnO2, whereas higher amounts of HAs completely inhibited heteroaggregation. The effect of alginate is similar to that of HAs, although not as significant, while PA had negligible effects on heteroaggregation. Different from the effects of Al ions and NOMs on MnO2 reactivity, the MnO2 reactivity in ternary mixtures of Al2O3, MnO2, and NOM was mostly enhanced. This suggests MnO2 reactivity was mainly affected through heteroaggregation in the ternary mixtures because of the limited availability of Al ions."},{"title":"Simple and Robust Approach for Passivating and Functionalizing Surfaces for Use in Complex Media","abstract":"Pluronic is a popular triblock copolymer used as a surfactant to introduce hydrophilic coatings onto many different types of material surfaces, from engineering to biomedical applications.

Couette sheared 1H and 31P NMR experiments carried out at varying temperature and water content show distinct signatures with microstructure evolution. Because the system has been fully characterized through small-angle neutron scattering, it is possible to relate the NMR signatures to the microstructure. The NMR technique therefore complements scattering techniques but is additionally useful because the technique also picks up isotropic signatures from concurrently occurring noncrystalline phases. The use of NMR to identify such lyotropic gel-like crystalline phases allows easy correlation between templated materials synthesis in these phases and phase microstructure. NMR can therefore be used as a probe to understand microstructure in specific surfactant systems and to characterize the retention of microstructure during materials synthesis."},{"title":"Sogami Potential and Membrane Equilibria","abstract":"Membrane equilibria are investigated using the Sogami potential for plate macroions. Two methods are used to calculate the ratio s of the electrolyte concentrations in the two phases in the two-phase region of colloid stability.

The approximation \u03a6d = 0, corresponding to the neglect of double-layer overlap, is found to lead from Sogami theory to the Donnan membrane equilibrium. An exponentially decaying electric potential function is used to estimate the effect of including the double-layer overlap. It is found that the intermacroionic interactions suppress the Donnan effect, leading to a reduced value of s that is roughly constant as a function of the surface potential, for any physically realistic surface potential greater than 40 mV. It is noted that this calculation of s may provide an explanation for the relative salinity of cells and sea water.

It is known that the catalytic reaction involves a hydride shift from NADPH and a proton transfer from a suitable proton donor to the carbonyl group of the substrate. However, the details of the process are still unclear. The present work explores the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme by using the semi-microscopic protein dipoles Langevin dipoles (PDLD\/S) and the empirical valence bond (EVB) methods. The pKa values of His-110 and Tyr-48 are evaluated to determine which of these two residues donates the proton in the reaction. It is found that the free energy of protonation of His-110 in its protein site is \u223c9 kcal\/mol and hence the pKa of this residue is abnormally low. Consequently, His-110 is not protonated in the active site of aldose reductase. On the other hand, it is found that the pKa of Tyr-48 is lowered to \u223c8.5 in the active site due to the stabilization by the unique local environment of the phenol group. We conclude that Tyr-48 acts as the proton donor in the reduction of aldehydes by aldose reductase, while the neutral His-110 has a role in substrate binding during the catalysis. To obtain a quantitative picture of the energetics of different feasible catalytic mechanisms in the protein we follow the EVB philosophy and calibrate the potential surface of the catalytic reaction in a solvent cage by using the relevant energetics from experiments. It is found that a mechanism where a proton transfer precedes the hydride transfer is unfavorable in the solvent cage, relative to the alternative mechanism where the hydride transfer precedes protonation. Furthermore, our study of the reaction in the actual protein environment indicates that an initial proton transfer step would require prohibitively high energy. Thus, the most probable catalytic mechanism commences with the hydride shift, followed by a proton transfer from Tyr-48. The calculations show that in water the activation barrier for the hydride shift is \u223c20 kcal\/mol, which is far above the barrier of the subsequent proton transfer. The protein environment stabilizes the transition state of the hydride shift by \u223c3 kcal\/mol and destabilizes the intermediate state by \u223c8 kcal\/mol relative to the corresponding states in the water cage. This finding is consistent with the physiological role of the enzyme in detoxification where it catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of carbonyl-containing substrates without particular specificity. It is argued that it may be difficult for an enzyme to both satisfy this demand and catalyze the reaction beyond the simple role of bringing the proton and hydride donor groups to the proximity of the substrate.

Wild-type and mutant forms of PTE have been tested for their ability to hydrolyze this series of compounds. Mutant forms of PTE with significantly enhanced, as well as relaxed or reversed, stereoselectivity have been identified. A number of variants exhibited dramatically improved kinetic constants for the catalytic hydrolysis of the more toxic SP enantiomers. Improvements of up to 3 orders of magnitude relative to the value of the wild-type enzyme were observed. Some of these mutants were tested against racemic mixtures of GB and GD.

This backbonding, along, with the proton uptake accompanying metal ion reduction, provides a compelling mechanism by which the metal-centered redox potential is correctly tuned for catalytic superoxide disproportionation."},{"title":"Identification of \u03b1-Tocopherol and Its Oxidation Products by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry","abstract":"This study aimed to determine \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1-T) and its thermal oxidation products simultaneously. A novel method based on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was developed. This approach was achieved by means of a BEH C18 analytical column under gradient elution conditions with eluents of acetonitrile\/isopropanol (1:9, v\/v) and acetonitrile\/water (4:6, v\/v). Compounds were elucidated through exact molecular mass and fragmentation ions obtained from the Q-TOF-MS detector. Two oxidation products, \u03b1-tocopheryl quinone and 5-formyl-\u03b3-tocopherol, were identified, and one new compound was determined. This approach offered a simple, precise, and reliable method to determine oxidation products of \u03b1-T, which may give a way to understand the mechanism of the thermal oxidative process of \u03b1-T."},{"title":"Current Rectification for Transport of Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids through Conical Nanopores","abstract":"We studied the transport of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) through charged conical nanopores using a Landau\u2013Ginzburg-type continuum model (Bazant et al. Phys. Rev. Lett2011, 106, 046102) that takes steric effect and strong ion\u2013ion correlations into account. When the surface charge is uniform on the pore wall, weak current rectification is observed. When the charge density near the pore base is removed, the ionic current is greatly suppressed under negative bias voltage while nearly unchanged under positive bias voltage, thereby leading to enhanced current rectification. These predictions agree qualitatively with prior experimental observations, and we elucidated them by analyzing the different components of the ionic current and the structural changes of electrical double layers (EDLs) at the pore tip under different bias voltages and surface charge patterns. These analyses reveal that the different modifications of the EDL structure near the pore tip by the positive and negative bias voltages cause the current rectification and the observed dependence on the distribution of surface charge on the pore wall. The fact that the current rectification phenomena are captured qualitatively by the simple model originally developed for describing EDLs at equilibrium conditions suggests that this model may be promising for understanding the ionic transport under nonequilibrium conditions when the EDL structure is strongly perturbed by external fields."},{"title":"Isolation and Structural Elucidation of Anthocyanidin 3,7-\u03b2-<i>O<\/i>-Diglucosides and Caffeoyl-glucaric Acids from Calafate Berries","abstract":"Calafate (Berberis microphylla G. Forst) is an edible wild berry growing in South Patagonia that is very rich in anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Calafate contains unusual phenolic compounds compared to other berries, such as anthocyanidin dihexosides, different from the common 3,5-diglucosides, and isomeric esters of caffeic acid with hexaric acids. After isolation, their structures have been elucidated by UV\u2013vis, MS\/MS, and NMR spectroscopies. The anthocyanidin dihexosides constitute the complete series of 3,7-\u03b2-O-diglucosides of the five anthocyanidins usually found in calafate, the structures of which were completely elucidated in the cases of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin derivatives and tentatively suggested in the cases of cyanidin and peonidin, and their occurrence seems to be characteristic of calafate among other wild berries from South Patagonia. With regard to caffeoyl-hexaric acids, two of four isomers have been assigned as 3- and 4-trans-caffeoyl-glucaric acids, but the determination of the linkage position for each isomer was not possible. A third isomer was also isolated, but it easily degraded and was suggested to be the 2- or 5-trans-caffeoyl-glucaric acid. The caffeoyl-glucaric acids account for around half of the pool of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in calafate."},{"title":"Thermochromic Phase Transition on CuMo<sub>0.9<\/sub>W<sub>0.1<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub>@SiO<sub>2<\/sub> Core\u2212Shell Particles","abstract":"The thermochromic phase transition of CuMo1\u2212xWxO4 oxide was delayed by the deposit of SiO2 shells.

Harshness of personal cleaning products is related to surfactant interactions with proteins and lipids. Surfactants can damage biomembranes either by solubilizing their components in surfactant micelles or by fluidizing lipid bilayers through surfactant penetration. The interactions of surfactants with simpler biomembranes such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl choline liposomes were first studied (Deo, N.; Somasundaran, P. Colloids Surf., A2001, 186, 33), and then cholesterol and zein protein were added to make the liposomes more realistic. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a model surfactant for this purpose. Results show that while cholesterol makes the liposomes more resistant toward SDS, protein enhances the liposome solubilization processes. The mechanisms of the above process were investigated using a multipronged approach involving UV\u2212visible spectroscopy, viscometry, and analytical ultracentrifugation. From viscometry and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis, it was seen that protein undergoes structural reorientation in the presence of SDS due to its strong affinity toward SDS, which stimulates the zein protein to be extracted away first from the bilayers. The preferential exits of zein protein out of the liposome membrane perturb the stability of the liposomes and enhance the liposome disintegration process.

The electronic and mechanical properties of graphene samples with high perfection of the atomic lattice are outstanding, but structural defects, which may appear during growth or processing, deteriorate the performance of graphene-based devices. However, deviations from perfection can be useful in some applications, as they make it possible to tailor the local properties of graphene and to achieve new functionalities. In this article, the present knowledge about point and line defects in graphene are reviewed. Particular emphasis is put on the unique ability of graphene to reconstruct its lattice around intrinsic defects, leading to interesting effects and potential applications. Extrinsic defects such as foreign atoms which are of equally high importance for designing graphene-based devices with dedicated properties are also discussed."},{"title":"Transfer Units Approach to the FricDiff Separation Process","abstract":"FricDiff (friction difference) is a recently introduced separation technology. The separation occurs because of differences in interspecies friction in a multicomponent mixture. We present a description of a FricDiff unit. Such a unit consists of two compartments, the feed-side and the sweep-side, with a porous screen in between. The gas mixtures at the feed-side and the sweep gas interdiffuse through the screen. The basic modeling assumption is that the binary interaction of each feed-component with a counterflowing sweep gas is dominant. The interaction between the components diffusing in the same direction is neglected. This assumption leads us to introduce the number of \u201cbinary transfer units\u201d. We show that more detailed models introduced earlier are approximated well by this approach. Also, experiments seem to exhibit the same scaling, although the constants needed to fit the experimental results deviate quite a lot from the theoretical predictions. The equations derived can be used straightforwardly for incorporating a FricDiff unit in a process design."},{"title":"Multiple-Acid Equilibria in Adsorption of Carboxylic Acids from Dilute Aqueous Solution","abstract":"Equilibria were measured for adsorption of carboxylic acids from aqueous, binary-acid mixtures of lactic and succinic acids and acetic and formic acids onto basic polymeric sorbents. The experimentally determined adsorption isotherms compared well with model predictions, confirming that simple extensions from adsorption of individual acids apply. Fixed-bed studies were carried out that establish the efficacy of chromatographic fractionation of lactic and succinic acids using basic polymeric sorbents. Finally, sequential thermal and solvent regeneration of lactic and acetic acid-laden sorbents was investigated as a method to fractionate among coadsorbed volatile and nonvolatile acids. Essentially complete removal of the acetic acid from the acid-laden sorbent was achieved by vaporization under the conditions used; a small amount of loss of lactic acid (about 11%) was observed.

The formation of Pt nanoparticles was evident from cyclic voltammetry measurement, whereas AFM and SEM revealed the size and size distribution of deposited Pt nanoparticles. Raman spectroscopy illustrated a correlation between the typical BDD signature and the number of platinum deposition cycles. Linear sweep voltammetry performed with the modified BDD microelectrode outperformed its macrocounterpart and resulted in very low detecting currents with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. With linearity up to 100 ppb and a detection limit of 0.5 ppb, the electrochemical system was applicable for processing tap and river water samples. Over 150 repetitive runs could be performed, and electrochemical etching of platinum allowed the reuse of the BDD microelectrode. The presence of copper and chloride ions, the two most severe interferents at levels commonly found in groundwater, did not interfere with the assay.

Here, we extend our studies on the molecular recognition of the h-P2Y1-R to the exploration of the diastereoselectivity of this receptor. For this purpose, we implemented an integrative approach combining synthesis, spectral analysis, biochemical assays, and computational analysis. Specifically, we selected and synthesized novel ATP analogues bearing a chiral center on the phosphate chain. We analyzed the conformation of the chiral ATP analogues in solution by 1H\/13C NMR and assigned the absolute configuration of the diastereoisomers. The coordination mode of these analogues with a Mg2+ ion was evaluated by 31P NMR. These chiral analogues were biochemically evaluated and found to be potent h-P2Y1-R ligands. An EC50 difference of ca. 20-fold was observed between the diastereoisomers. Their spectral absolute configuration assignment was confirmed by comparison of the biochemical results to those of ATP-\u03b1-S diastereoisomers whose chirality is known. Finally, a computational analysis was performed for the elucidation of molecular recognition employing molecular mechanics (docking) studies on the receptor:ligands complexes. On the basis of the current results, we hypothesize that h-P2Y1-R's chiral discrimination originates from the requirement that the nucleotide analogue interacts with a Mg2+ ion within the receptor binding site. This Mg2+ ion is possibly coordinated with both Asp204 and the ATP's \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3-phosphates in a \u039b configuration.

Though highly selective organic cation exchange resins have been developed for most pollutants, they can serve as a growth medium for bacterial proliferation, impairing their long-term stability and introducing unpredictable parameters into the evolution of the system. Zeolites represent a family of inorganic cation exchangers, which naturally occur in hyper alkaline conditions and cannot serve as an electron donor or carbon source for microbial proliferation. Despite their successful application as industrial cation exchangers under near neutral conditions, their performance in hyper alkaline, saline water remains highly undocumented. Using Cs+ as a benchmark element, this study aims to assess the long-term cation exchange performance of zeolites in concrete derived aqueous solutions. Comparison of their exchange properties in alkaline media with data obtained in near neutral solutions demonstrated that the cation exchange selectivity remains unaffected by the increased hydroxyl concentration; the cation exchange capacity did however show an unexpected increase in hyper alkaline media."},{"title":"Unusual Ligand Transformations Initiated by dppm Deprotonation in Methylene-Bridged Rh\/Os Complexes","abstract":"The reaction of [RhOs(CO)3(\u03bc-CH2)(dppm)2][CF3SO3] (dppm = \u03bc-Ph2PCH2PPh2) with 1,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazol-2-ylidene (IMe4) results in competing substitution of the Rh-bound carbonyl by IMe4 and dppm deprotonation by IMe4 to give the two products [RhOs(IMe4)(CO)2(\u03bc-CH2)(dppm)2][CF3SO3] and [RhOs(CO)3(\u03bc-CH2)(\u03bc-\u03ba1:\u03b72-dppm-H)(dppm)] [3; dppm-H = bis(diphenylphosphino)methanide], respectively.

Given that conjugated polymer films cast in different ways also show different nanometer-scale surface topographies, the question that arises is:\u2009 What is the correlation between surface topography, local chain packing, and the local electronic properties of a conjugated polymer film? In this paper, we address this question using fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) to examine films of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2\u2018-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) that were prepared in different ways. The spatially resolved photoluminescence (SRPL) spectra collected on top of the nanometer-scale topographic features (\u201cbumps\u201d) exhibited by spin-cast MEH-PPV films show an enhancement of the red portion of the emission relative to spectra collected from flat regions of the film. Moreover, photooxidative damage (signified by a red-shift and drop in quantum yield of the SRPL) occurs much more quickly in the flat regions of the MEH-PPV films than on the topographic bumps. Taken together, these observations suggest that the bumps on the films correspond to regions in which the chains are packed more tightly:\u2009 the red-shifted emission results from increased interchain interactions, while the decreased photooxidation rate results from the fact that oxygen cannot easily diffuse between the tightly packed polymer chains. We also find that the spatial homogeneity of MEH-PPV films can be greatly improved by annealing:\u2009 heating the films above the glass transition temperature removes the topographic features and produces a uniform but weak and red-shifted SRPL due to increased interchain interactions. In contrast to spin-cast films, the SRPL of annealed films undergoes a blue-shift upon photooxidation. This result can be explained by considering the differences between the local chain packing in annealed and nonannealed films, combined with the fact that excitations in the film tend to migrate to low-energy aggregated-chain \u201ctraps\u201d. All of these results provide insight into how polymer film morphology can be controlled through film processing conditions to improve the optical properties and the performance of electroluminescent devices based on this class of materials.

An efficient synthesis of PCP2A is based on the macrocyclization reaction between 2,6-bis(chloromethyl)pyridine and a 1,4,7-triazaheptane derivative bearing a methylenephosphonate group on N-4. The Gd(III) complex of PCP2A displays characteristic properties which make it a very promising contrast agent for improved applications in magnetic resonance imaging. In fact it shows (i) a very high stability constant (log KGdPCP2A = 23.4) which should guarantee against the in vivo release of toxic free Gd(III) ions and free ligand molecules and (ii) a relaxivity that is about 2 times higher than the values reported for contrast agents currently used in the clinical practice. Its high relaxivity is the result of the presence of two water molecules in the inner coordination sphere and a significant contribution from water molecule(s) hydrogen bonded to the phosphonate group. Moreover, the inner sphere water molecules are involved in an exchange with the bulk water which is relatively fast. This property is important for the attainment of an even higher relaxivity once the molecular reorientation rate of the [GdPCP2A(H2O)2]- moiety is lengthened by means of conjugation to a macromolecular substrate.

Two-dimensional materials can expose only one type of crystal facet among zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) materials. Controllable tuning of the nature of the external crystal facets of 2D materials is highly desirable but very challenging. Here, we show that 2D particles with the desirable crystal facet for high-performance photocatalytic H2 generation can be obtained by using 2D metal oxide materials (i.e., nanosheets of Ca2Nb3O10 and Ti0.87O2) as templates taking consideration of the crystal configuration of 2D oxide and target compounds. We demonstrate that anatase TiO2 crystals grown on different nanosheet templates exhibit variations in photocatalytic hydrogen production rates from aqueous phase methanol solutions (6.7%), which can be attributed to the nature of the main crystal facet exposed. In view of the large number of 2D materials that have already been synthesized, this work offers a key to design and synthesize nanoparticles with the desirable specific external crystal facet for (photo)catalysis application."},{"title":"Photopolymerization of Reactive Amphiphiles: Automatic and Robust Vertical Alignment Layers of Liquid Crystals with a Strong Surface Anchoring Energy","abstract":"A photopolymerizable itaconic acid-based amphiphile (abbreviated as Ita3C12) consisting of a hydrophilic carboxylic acid, three alkyl tails, and a reactive vinyl function was newly designed and synthesized for the formation of automatic and robust vertical alignment (VA) layer of nematic liquid crystals (NLC). Since a hydrophilic carboxylic acid was chemically attached to the end of Ita3C12, the Ita3C12 amphiphiles initially dissolved in the host NLC medium were migrated toward the substrates for the construction of VA layer of NLC. The alkyl tails of Ita3C12 in the VA layer directly interacted with host NLC molecules and made them to automatically align vertically. Because of the reactive vinyl functions of Ita3C12 amphiphiles, it was possible to stabilize the automatic VA layer by the photopolymerization with methacryl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (MAPOSS) cross-linkers. The polymer-stabilized robust Ita3C12 VA layer exhibited a strong surface anchoring energy without generating any light scatterings.

Conventional thermally conductive composites are static and passive. Thermoresponsive polymeric composites are dynamic and active; they are able to perceive changes in ambient temperature and exhibit simple and direct responses, which have attracted considerable attention. Herein, thermoresponsive polymeric composites were achieved using an elastic boron nitride framework (BNF) as the architecture and a phase-transition matrix for \u201cfreezing\u201d temporary shapes. We use molecular simulation guiding to control the dual-cross-linked network that is based on its stable chemical bond as permanent cross-linking and tunable composition of the hydrogen bond as recoverable cross-linking.

In addition, we optimized the design of the thermal conductive network to obtain thermoresponsive polymeric composites with their own good thermal conductivity and thermal transfer capability. The obtained thermoresponsive polymeric composites have good heat dissipation (\u0394Tmax = 10 \u00b0C), indicating temperature capability through the self-shape change.

Sorption and Desorption on Soils","abstract":"Methylated forms of arsenic (As), monomethylarsenate (MMA), and dimethylarsenate (DMA) have historically been used as herbicides and pesticides. Because of their large application to agriculture fields and the toxicity of MMA and DMA, the persistency of these compounds in the environment is of great concern. MMA and DMA sorption and desorption were investigated in soils, varying in mineralogical and organic matter (OM) contents. Sorption studies showed that the MMA sorption capacity and rate were greater than DMA sorption. Al\/Fe-oxyhydroxides were the main sorbents in the soils, and the sorption capacity was proportional to the Al\/Fe concentration in the soils. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies showed that both MMA\/DMA-Fe interatomic distances were around 3.3 \u00c5, which were indicative of bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complex formation. Desorption studies showed that not all of the sorbed MMA or DMA was desorbed due to the strong binding between MMA\/DMA and Al\/Fe-oxyhydroxide surfaces via possible inner-sphere complex formation. The amount of the desorbed MMA and DMA decreased as the sorption residence time increased. For example, 77% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the Reybold subsoil after 1 day residence time, while 66% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the soil after six months of residence time. The decreases in desorption were likely due to As speciation changes from MMA\/DMA to inorganic arsenate, which was more strongly bound to the surface."},{"title":"Multiresponsive Star-Graft Quarterpolymer Monolayers","abstract":"Multifunctional star-graft quarterpolymers PSn[P2VP-b-(PAA-g-PNIPAM)]n with two different arm types, shorter PS arms and longer P2VP-b-PAA block copolymer arms with grafted PNIPAM chains, were studied in terms of their ability to form micellar structures at the air\/water and air\/solid interfaces. Because of the pH-dependent ionization of P2VP and PAA blocks, as well as thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAM chains, these multifunctional stars have multiple responsive properties to pH, temperature, and ionic strength. We observed that the molecular surface area of the stars is the largest at basic pH, when the PAA blocks are strongly charged and extended, and PNIPAM chains are spread at the interface. At acidic conditions, the molecular surface area is the smallest because the P2VP blocks submerge into the water subphase and the PAA blocks are contracted and form hydrogen bonding with grafted PNIPAM chains. The molecular surface area of the stars at the air\/water interface gradually increases at elevated temperature. We suggest that the transition across lower critical solution temperature (LCST) results in the emerging of PNIPAM chains from the water subphase to the interface due to the hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition. Moreover, at higher surface pressure, the stars tend to form intermolecular micellar aggregates above LCST. The graft density of PNIPAM chains as well as the arm number was also found to have strong effects on the thermo- and pH-response. Overall, this study demonstrates that the star block copolymer conformation and aggregation are strongly dependent on the intramolecular interactions between different blocks and spatial distribution of the arms, which can be controlled by the external conditions, including pH, temperature, ionic strength, and surface pressure."},{"title":"Isotope Fractionation Associated with the Indirect Photolysis of Substituted Anilines in Aqueous Solution","abstract":"Organic micropollutants containing aniline substructures are susceptible to different light-induced transformation processes in aquatic environments and water treatment operations.

The transformation of aniline, 4-CH3-, 4-OCH3-, and 4-Cl-aniline by excited triplet states of the photosensitizers was associated with inverse and normal N isotope fractionation, whereas C isotope fractionation was negligible. The apparent 15N kinetic isotope effects (AKIE) were almost identical for both photosensitizers, increased from 0.9958 \u00b1 0.0013 for 4-OCH3-aniline to 1.0035 \u00b1 0.0006 for 4-Cl-aniline, and correlated well with the electron donating properties of the substituent. N isotope fractionation is pH-dependent in that H+ exchange reactions dominate below and N atom oxidation processes above the pKa value of the substituted aniline\u2019s conjugate acid. Correlations of C and N isotope fractionation for indirect phototransformation were different from those determined previously for the direct photolysis of chloroanilines and offer new opportunities to distinguish between abiotic degradation pathways."},{"title":"Dual Stimuli-Responsive Hybrid Polymeric Nanoparticles Self-Assembled from POSS-Based Starlike Copolymer-Drug Conjugates for Efficient Intracellular Delivery of Hydrophobic Drugs","abstract":"To further fine tune drug release and enhance therapeutic effects of polyhedral oligomericsilsesquioxane (POSS)-based nanomedicine, a starlike organic\u2013inorganic conjugate was synthesized by grafting semitelechelic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers to a POSS rigid core through reductively degradable disulfide bonds.

With 4 days between events, only the dissolved pentachlorinated PCBs decreased significantly (p = 0.002), suggesting that the easily desorbable PCBs recharge when there is sufficient time between resuspension events.

We investigated the effect of solvent-induced swelling on the kinetics of multiple energy transfer in nanoparticles of the conjugated polymers PFBT and MEH-PPV. Multiple energy transfer between equivalent chromophores results in an increased rate of quenching by defects due to a cascading or funneling effect. The effects of swelling on energy transfer between polymer chromophores and the resulting exciton dynamics were modeled using a random walk on a lattice of chromophores. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental fluorescence quantum yield, and decay kinetics results at low to moderate THF concentrations. We found that the time scale for energy transfer between chromophores (\u223c5 ps for MEH-PPV nanoparticles and \u223c100 ps for PFBT nanoparticles) is highly sensitive to swelling, slowing by an order of magnitude or more for swelled particles.

II. Compatibility of an Extended Model with Previously Reported Model-Data Correspondences","abstract":"In the course of formulating detailed models of complex chemical reactions, it is sometimes the case that modifications intended to account for one set of experimental observations wind up destroying a model's ability to account for other results. Here, we consider a recently proposed model of the peroxidase-oxidase reaction which derives from an earlier scheme via the addition of NADH oxidation by superoxide anion or its protonated form, hydroperoxyl radical. This modification was introduced to account for the observation of bistability and bursting at enzyme concentrations less than 0.5 \u03bcM. Left unanswered in our previous paper was the matter of whether the proposed \u201cfix\u201d invalidates previously published examples of model-data agreement at higher enzyme concentrations. In the present paper, we show that under these latter circumstances, the new mechanism is as good as, and in some instances superior to, its predecessor. More generally, we argue that the consequences of NADH oxidation by O2- or HO2\u2022 should be manifest principally at low enzyme concentrations, thereby offering a \u201cglobal\u201d explanation of our findings. Neither our original model, nor the derivative scheme treated here, provides for reactions involving NAD dimers, a species in which there has recently been renewed interest. Most importantly, it has been proposed to replace the reduction of coIII (an enzyme intermediate) by NAD radicals, a reaction for which there is no direct evidence, with the corresponding reaction involving NAD2. While a detailed assessment of the consequences of dimer chemistry to theoretical peroxidase-oxidase dynamics is beyond the scope of the present investigation, it is easily documented that this substitution, by itself, abolishes oscillatory behavior for all model parametrizations previously considered. Moreover, this result appears to obtain for arbitrarily small values of the associated rate constant. Whether or not the inclusion of additional dimer reactions can restore the model's ability to account for experimental observations of complex dynamics remains to be determined.

This compound represents the first ternary perovskite prepared containing Sb5+ on the octahedral site. The octahedral tilting distortion in this compound is much larger than expected from ionic radii considerations. The distortion is driven by a second-order Jahn\u2212Teller distortion originating on oxygen that can be traced back to strong Sb\u2212O covalent bonding. A conflict arises between the strong covalent bonding interactions at oxygen that favor a large octahedral tilting distortion and the repulsive Na\u2212O interactions that oppose excessive octahedral tilting. This conflict destabilizes the perovskite topology, thereby stabilizing the ilmenite polymorph under ambient conditions. Analysis of ionic and covalent bonding explains why ASbO3 and ABiO3 compositions frequently adopt structures that violate Pauling's rules.

A latitudinal gradient with higher levels in the south was found for the sum of PCB as well as for individual congeners, and the gradient was more pronounced for the low volatility congeners. As a result, the high volatility congeners increased in relative importance with latitude. Generally, PCB concentrations increased with temperature, but slopes of the partial pressure in air versus reciprocal temperature were different between congeners and between stations. In general, the low volatility congeners were more temperature dependent than the high volatility PCB congeners. Steep slopes at a sampling location indicate that the concentration in air is largely determined by diffusive exchange with soils. Lack of a temperature dependence may be due to the influence of long-range transported air masses at remote sites and due to the episodic or random nature of PCB sources at urban sites.

Here, we designed a DNA-directed programmable assembly strategy to fabricate a halo-like Au nanostructure (nanohalo) that couples plasmonic large gold nanoparticles (L-AuNPs) with catalytically active small AuNPs (S-AuNPs) in a single nanoarchitecture. Catalytic reaction occurring on S-AuNPs changes its permittivity, which results in a significant variation of the plasmonic resonance of the nanohalo. Hence, we can indirectly monitor catalytic reactions on a single nanohalo under DFM, on the basis of which we have obtained quantitative information on both nanocatalysis and catalyst poisoning. Our study thus provides a cost-effective means to quantitatively study metal NP-based catalysis at single-particle level."},{"title":"Selective Formation of Both Enantiomerically Pure Disilanes from One Fluorosilane Antipode with Silyllithium","abstract":"Stereochemistry crossover from retention to inversion of configuration at about \u221220 \u00b0C was observed in the nucleophilic substitution of optically active (R)-fluoromethyl(1-naphthyl)phenylsilane ((R)-2F; &gt;99% ee) with the achiral silyllithium species (dimethyl(4-methoxynaphth-1-yl)silyl)lithium (1) to give optically active 1,1,2-trimethyl-2-(4-methoxy-1-naphthyl)-1-(1-naphthyl)disilane (3).

The experimental and computational study here of a \u03b2-ketoacid decarboxylation shows how the distinction between the two mechanisms breaks down near its border due to the differing time scales for proton versus heavy-atom motion. Isotope effects in the decarboxylation of benzoylacetic acid support a transition state in which the proton transfer is complete. In quasiclassical trajectories passing through this transition state, the new O\u2013H bond after proton transfer undergoes several vibrations before heavy-atom motion completes the reaction. The bonding changes are thus temporally separated at a \u201cdynamic intermediate\u201d structure that acts equivalently to an ordinary intermediate in the trajectories, including the reversal of trajectories at the intermediate when the second \u201cstep\u201d fails, but the structure is not an energy minimum.

Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem-MS (MS\/MS) were used to characterize and identify pyrolysis cleavage products, confirming that sequence information is conserved after the pyrolysis process in both peptides and protein tested. This suggests that pyrolysis-induced cleavage at aspartyl residues can be used as a rapid protein digestion procedure for the generation of sequence-specific protein biomarkers.

The latter value is larger due to a combination of greater stability of the sulfide relative to the oxide and of the relative instability of thiepin compared to oxepin. For the dimethyl analog of the benzene oxide\/oxepin system (9 and 10) the \u0394H at the same level is \u22126.73 kJ mol-1. The calculated molecular orbital energies are in linear relationship to those available from photoelectron spectra and suggest reassignment in some cases. The structures of the transition states for the conformational inversion of oxepin and of thiepin are shown to be planar, and the QCISD(T) enthalpies of inversion are 14.5 and 30.5 kJ mol-1, respectively.

Experiments illustrate that the decomposition of thiourea oxides is a first-order reaction, in which the rate constants increase with the pH of the solution. Oxidations of thiourea oxides by hydrogen peroxide are first order with respect to both reagents within the studied pH range between 4.0 and 8.0. Oxidation rate constants are measured under different pH conditions, which show that increasing the pH of the reaction solution significantly accelerates the oxidation process.

Herein, we focus on the investigation of carrier dynamics of a triphenylamine-based dye, LEG4, sensitized TiO2 (LEG4\/TiO2) in contact with two types of electrolyte systems: pure cobalt-based electrolytes and in combination with an organic donor, tri(p-anisyl)amine (TPAA). Four different cobalt redox systems with potentials spanning a 0.3 V range were studied, and the carrier recombination and regeneration kinetics were monitored both at low and at high TiO2 (e\u2013) densities (1.3 \u00d7 1018 and 1.3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u20133, respectively). The results reveal that the introduction of the TPAA intermediate more effectively suppress the recombination loss of TiO2 (e\u2013) under high charge conditions, close to open-circuit, as compared to low charge conditions. As a result, the charge transfer from the cobalt complexes to the oxidized dyes is significantly improved by the addition of TPAA. Dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the TPAA-containing electrolytes demonstrate remarkable improvement in both VOC and JSC and lead to more than 25% increase of the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Furthermore, an unprecedented detrimental impact of TPAA on the device performance was identified when the redox potential of the TPAA donor and the cobalt complexes are close. This is ascribed to the formation of TPAA\u2022+ which can act as an active recombination centers and thus lower the solar cell performance. These insights point at a strategy to enhance the lifetimes of electrons generated in sensitized semiconductor electrodes by overcoming the charge recombination between TiO2 and the oxidized dye under high carrier densities in the semiconductor substrate and offer practical guidance to the design of future efficient electrolyte systems for dye-sensitized solar cells."},{"title":"Copper-Catalyzed Synthesis of \u03b1-Amino Imides from Tertiary Amines: Ugi-Type Three-Component Assemblies Involving Direct Functionalization of sp<sup>3<\/sup> C\u2212Hs Adjacent to Nitrogen Atoms","abstract":"  \u03b1-Amino imides can be accessed straightforwardly from tertiary amines through copper-catalyzed three-component reactions involving the direct functionalization of sp3 C\u2212Hs adjacent to nitrogen atoms.

The signal decays in the PFG experiments have been recorded for 1 wt % F127 in the temperature range from 288 to 313 K and in the concentration range 0.1\u221235 wt % at 298 K. Below the critical micellization temperature (cmt) or the critical micellization concentration (cmc), the PFG signal decays approximately linearly when the intensities are plotted on a logarithmic scale versus the experimentally relevant parameter. At the cmt or cmc, the signal decays are curved. The NMR data were processed using inverse Laplace transformation to obtain the distribution of self-diffusion coefficients, P(D). At 288 K for a 1 wt % solution, a narrow distribution was observed, while at 302 K a bimodal distribution was observed. This observation can be explained by the polydispersity of the polymer. It implies that, at a given temperature, only the more hydrophobic compound of F127 takes part in the aggregation process, while the more hydrophilic components diffuse as free nonassociated polymer. Increasing the temperature to 313 K resulted in a monomodal distribution, suggesting that all the polymers are aggregated. It is suggested that an ideal mixing model for the Pluronic micelles can explain the self-diffusion data. The NMR self-diffusion raw data were also analyzed with the COmponent REsolved (CORE; Stilbs, P.; Paulsen, K. Rev. Sci. Instrum.1996, 67, 4380\u22124386) algorithm, resulting in spectra for free block copolymer and micellized block copolymer. With an increase in temperature, the intensity of the peaks for free block copolymer is reduced, whereas the intensity of the peaks for aggregated block copolymer increases. The ratios between the size of the PEO and PPO blocks (mEO\/nPO) show a marked increase in free polymer compared to the ratio observed in micellized polymer when the temperature is increased. The effect of added salts to a 1 wt % F127 solution at 303 K was investigated to determine how the populations of free and micellized surfactant were changed on account of the ions present. Finally, the diffusion behavior of Pluronic F68 (EO76PO29EO76) at 35 wt % has been investigated from 298 to 313 K. Both the diffusion time and the time of the gradient have been varied. The data show that the diffusion is Gaussian in the temperature range. "},{"title":"An Unexpected Phosphine-Catalyzed [3 + 2] Annulation.

The present discussion puts the Wenzel and Cassie\u2212Baxter equations into proper mathematical\u2212thermodynamic perspective and defines the conditions for determining the transition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous wetting regimes.

The activity of the support was compared with that of fully formulated catalysts containing palladium. The Pd\/CeZrAlOx material exhibited long-term stability and selectivity to propene (during continuous operation for 140 h), which is not normally associated with dehydrogenation catalysts. From temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 it was found that the catalyst possessed both acidic and basic sites. In addition, temperature-programmed reduction showed that palladium promoted both the reduction and reoxidation of the support. When the role of CO2 was investigated in the absence of gas-phase oxidant, using a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor, it was found that CO2 dissociates over the reduced catalyst, leading to formation of CO and selective oxygen species. It is proposed that CO2 has the dual role of regenerating selective oxygen species and shifting the equilibrium for alkane dehydrogenation by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction. These two mechanistic functions have previously been considered to be mutually exclusive."},{"title":"Synthetic and Computational Studies on the Thermal and Photochemical Reactions of [NPN]TaMe<sub>3<\/sub> (NPN = PhP(CH<sub>2<\/sub>SiMe<sub>2<\/sub>NPh)<sub>2<\/sub>) and [<sup>Mes<\/sup>NPN]TaMe<sub>3<\/sub> (<sup>Mes<\/sup>NPN = PhP(CH<sub>2<\/sub>SiMe<sub>2<\/sub>N(2,4,6-Me<sub>3<\/sub>C<sub>6<\/sub>H<sub>2<\/sub>))<sub>2<\/sub>)","abstract":"The thermolysis of [PhP(CH2SiMe2NPh)2]TaMe3 leads to the elimination of methane and the formation of cyclometalated derivative [PhP(CH2SiMe2NPh)(CH2SiMe2N-o-C6H4)]TaMe2, which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray analysis.

These enzymes exhibit little sequence similarity in their substrates binding domains, but share a highly conserved catalytic site, suggesting a similar activation mechanism for the oxidation of their substrates. In this study, the fully conserved histidine residue at position 466 of choline oxidase was replaced with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis and the biochemical, spectroscopic, and mechanistic properties of the resulting CHO-H466A mutant enzyme were characterized. CHO-H466A showed kcat and kcat\/Km values with choline as substrate that were 60- and 1000-fold lower than the values for the wild-type enzyme, while the kcat\/Km value for oxygen was unaffected, suggesting the involvement of His466 in the oxidation of the alcohol substrate but not in the reduction of oxygen. Replacement of His466 with alanine significantly affected the microenvironment of the flavin, as indicated by the altered behavior of CHO-H466A with sulfite and dithionite. In agreement with this conclusion, a midpoint reduction potential of +106 mV for the two-electron transfer in the catalytically competent enzyme\u2212product complex was determined at pH 7 for CHO-H466A, which was \u223c25 mV more negative than that of the wild-type enzyme. Enzymatic activity in CHO-H466A could be partially rescued with exogenous imidazolium, but not imidazole, consistent with the protonated form of histidine exerting a catalytic role. pH profiles for glycine betaine inhibition, the deprotonation of the N(3)-flavin locus, and the kcat\/Km value for choline all showed a significant shift upward in their pKa values, consistent with a change in the polarity of the active site. Finally, kinetic isotope effects with isotopically labeled substrate and solvent indicated that the histidine to alanine substitution affected the timing of substrate OH and CH bond cleavages, consistent with removal of the hydroxyl proton being concerted with hydride transfer in the mutant enzyme. All taken together, the results presented in this study suggest that in choline oxidase, His466 modulates the electrophilicity of the enzyme-bound flavin and the polarity of the active site, and contributes to the stabilization of the transition state for the oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde.

All four complexes contain a 1,4,7-triazacyclononane macrocyclic backbone with two hydroxypropyl pendant groups, an ancillary aryl or biphenyl group, and a coordination site for a water ligand. The pH potentiometric titrations support one or two deprotonations of the complexes, most likely deprotonation of hydroxypropyl groups at near-neutral pH. Variable-temperature 17O NMR studies suggest that the inner-sphere water ligand is slow to exchange with bulk water on the NMR time scale. Water proton T1 relaxation times measured for solutions of the Fe(III) complexes at pH 7.2 showed that the dinuclear complexes have a 2- to 3-fold increase in r1 relaxivity in comparison to the mononuclear complex per molecule at field strengths ranging from 1.4 T to 9.4 T.

Our objective is to understand the organization of complex interfaces between blood plasma preparations of various compositions and model titania surfaces. Here we present the results of the morphological and chemical characterization of TiO2 surfaces incubated with four types of blood plasma preparations devoid of leukocytes and red blood cells: either enriched in platelets (PRGF-Endoret) or platelet-depleted, and either activated with CaCl2 to induce clotting, or not. Chemical characterization was done by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with principal component analysis (ToF-SIMS\/PCA). The interface morphology was studied with scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify platelets and infer their activation state. We observe clear differences among the four types of interfaces by ToF-SIMS\/PCA. Some of these could be straightforwardly related to the differences in the sample morphology and known effects of platelet activation, but others are more subtle. Strikingly, it was possible to differentiate between these samples by ToF-SIMS\/PCA of the protein species alone.

These include in situ synthesis directly on the array surface, for example, by photolithography or ink-jet printing technologies, and the application of presynthesized polynucleotides that are derivatized with various nucleophiles or electrophiles. In the latter case, a variety of surface chemistries have been developed, and several are available commercially. These chemistries must be compatible with nanoliter-scale volumes of polynucleotide reagents, which contact the array over a small portion of their surface. We reasoned that a three-dimensional polymer coating could potentially offer greater surface contact and higher binding efficiency. Here we describe a polyethylenimine-based coating chemistry that provides exceptional binding and hybridization characteristics. In our preferred process, size-fractionated polyethylenimine polymers are cross-linked onto an aminopropylsilanated glass surface in the presence of cyanuric chloride. The resulting three-dimensional coating binds polynucleotides through a mixture of covalent and noncovalent interactions as evidenced by comparisons between 5\u2018-aminoalkyl modified and unmodified polynucleotides.

Wet milling is robust, relatively easy to use, broadly applicable, and offers both financial and API physical property advantages over dry milling. Historical rotor\u2013stator wet mill technologies are generally capable of achieving particles sizes down to \u223c25 \u03bcm. Newer high-shear wet mills allow for a reduction of particle size down to \u223c10\u201315 \u03bcm. In addition to the improved particle size reduction, recent wet mill designs better maintain geometric consistency across the product line, thereby providing enhanced scalability. A traditional scale-up approach for wet milling involved maintaining the tip speed of the rotor (assuming constant shear gap and thus constant shear rate) and would generally allow comparable terminal particle size (that near steady-state particle size where particle size reduction drastically slows) across scales. In order to predict the milling time upon scale-up the number of passes, or batch turnover, through the mill was kept constant. However, this prediction of the required milling time was often less successful than the prediction of the terminal particle size. Studies presented here confirmed the importance of maintaining constant rotor tip speed across scales to achieve the predicted terminal particle size and identified the importance of additional parameters to address particle breakage kinetics to allow prediction of the required milling time to achieve the target particle size. Additional aspects of hydrodynamics, shear rates, and equipment properties were assessed as part of these scale-up model optimization efforts. Specific processing parameters evaluated included flow rate, API slurry solids concentration, and starting particle size distribution. Ultimately, the Slot Event Model was developed to incorporate the critical geometric parameters by considering the frequency and the probability of a slot event. In addition to applying the revised model across scales, further model verification was achieved by evaluating custom rotor\u2013stator mill heads. Studies with these custom mill heads provided insight into the importance of mill efficiency and slot events. This, in turn, allowed for more accurate scale-up of not only the terminal particle size but also the milling time required to achieve the target particle size. The success of the optimized model reduces the reliance on in-process controls or at-line testing for determining the end point of milling."},{"title":"Ternary Nanoparticles with a Sheddable Shell Efficiently Deliver MicroRNA-34a against CD44-Positive Melanoma","abstract":"PEGylation can stabilize drug delivery systems for cancer therapy by creating repulsive interactions with biological components in vivo.

To circumvent this so-called \u201cPEG-dilemma\u201d, we have developed nanoparticles with a PEG coating that is shed after arrival in target tissue. Positively charged polycation nanoparticles were assembled with microRNA-34a via electrostatic interactions and then coated again via electrostatic interactions with an anionic PEG derivative that separates from the nanoparticle in the acidic tumor microenvironment. The resulting ternary nanoparticles with a sheddable shell have nearly neutral surface charge, which markedly reduces nonspecific adsorption. Shedding the PEG coat enhanced nanoparticle uptake into CD44-positive melanoma cells and promoted microRNA-34a release, which down-regulated CD44 expression and thereby inhibited tumor growth. We conclude that nanocarriers with a sheddable shell show promise for cancer therapy."},{"title":"Structure Change Associated with the [M<sup>II\/III<\/sup> 1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-N,N\u2032,N\u2032\u2032-triacetate (TCTA)]<sup>\u2212\/0<\/sup> Electron Transfers (M = Mn, Fe, and Ni): Crystal Structure for [Fe<sup>II<\/sup>(H<sub>2<\/sub>O)<sub>6<\/sub>][Fe<sup>II<\/sup>(TCTA)]<sub>2<\/sub>","abstract":"Heterogeneous electron-transfer rate measurements using the scanning electrochemical microscope are reported for the [M(TCTA)]\u2212\/0 couples (M = Mn, Fe, and Ni) in aqueous solution.

The blue compound 1 is formed by wheel-shaped cationic heptameric units where the copper atoms are bridged by hydroxide anions, water molecules, and adeninato ligands with a \u03bc-\u03baN3:\u03baN9 coordination mode. The assembly of the heptameric entities and the theobrominate anions takes place mainly through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions involving the adeninato ligands and theobrominate moieties. Although compound 1 exhibits an open-framework with voids representing 37% of the unit cell, the plasticity of the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions causes a reversible shrinkage of the porous system upon activation that precludes the adsorption of gas molecules. Dark purple compounds 2\u20134 contain neutral windmill units in which two copper atoms are bridged by four \u03bc-\u03baN3:\u03baN9 adeninato ligands. Their final crystal structure highly depends on the supramolecular interactions of the theobromine and caffeine molecules.

However, a large amount of binders and conductive agents are still required for the reliable performance of Si anodes. Herein, we have introduced free-standing Si electrodes, which show suppressed swelling property (31.29%) after the 100th cycle in spite of no binders. Carbon-coated Si nanoparticle (NP) via thermal decomposition of acetylene (C2H2) gas was confined in the bundles of copper nanowires (Cu NWs) that provide not only high electrical conductivity but also accommodation of volume changes of Si NPs. The carbon coating layer helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the surface of Si NPs. Furthermore, two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide effectively combines Si NPs and Cu NWs, which maintains the electron pathway and structural stability of electrodes during cycling. As a result, the free-standing Si anodes showed high capacity (1942 mAh g\u20131Si at the initial cycle) as well as long cycle stability (1753 mAh g\u20131Si at 200 cycles, 90.26%), based on acceptable impedance data of lower charge transfer resistance (27.57 \u03a9) and higher diffusion coefficient (35.61 \u00d7 10\u201313 cm2\u00b7s\u20131).

At the MP2\/6-311++G** level of theory, the equatorial conformer is more stable by 310 cm-1 than the axial conformer, and the inversion barrier height is 2033 cm-1. Two transitions in the UV, with origins of 38\u2009707 and 44\u2009070 cm-1 are assigned. The S1 \u2190 S0 transition (fobs \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 10-3) is Rydberg in nature, with considerable involvement of all the ring heavy atoms. A vibrational analysis of this transition shows a main progression in 640 cm-1, which is assigned as the N\u2212H out-of-plane bending motion. The CIS-calculated equilibrium geometry of the S1 state indicates considerable distortion of the N atom relative to the C\u03b1 atoms. The one-dimensional absorption spectrum is modeled on the basis of the ground-state IRC and the corresponding vertical CAS(2,2)\/MP2 surface. The IRC dependence of the transition moment was taken into account. The radiative rate constant, kr, is estimated be ca. 1.7 \u00d7 106 s-1. A weak fluorescence with \u03bd\u0303max = 33\u2009500 cm-1 is observed with a quantum efficiency, qf, of ca. 1.3 \u00d7 10-4. The lifetime of the S1 state is estimated to be ca. 80 ps on the basis of qf\/kr. Deuterium substitution (d1 and d11) results in slight increases in qf.

The thickness as a function of polymerization time has been studied by varying different parameters such as the bromine content of the initiator layer, polarity of reaction medium, ligand type (L), and the ratio of activator (CuI) to deactivator (CuII) in order to ascertain the controllability of the SI-ATRP process. The variation of thickness versus surface concentration of bromine shows a gradual transition from mushroom to brush-type conformation of the surface anchored chains in both polar and nonpolar reaction medium. Interestingly, it is revealed that very thick polymer brushes, on the order of 1 \u03bcm, can be obtained at high bromine content of the initiator layer in toluene. The initial polymerization rate and the overall final thickness are higher in the case of nonpolar solvent (toluene) compared to polar medium (acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide). The ligand affects the initial rate of polymerization, which correlates with the redox potentials of the pertinent CuII\/CuI complexes (L = Me6TREN, PMDETA, and BIPY). It is also observed that the ability of polymer brushes to reinitiate depends on the initial thickness and the solvent used for generating it."},{"title":"Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) of Fluorescent Flavonoid Dyes: A Close Look by Low Temperature Fluorescence","abstract":"Flavonoids have emerged to be an important molecular frame for chemical sensors, due to their capability to give dual emission and their compatibility to biological cells.

By freezing the sample solution in liquid N2, the study detected the \u201clocally excited\u201d state at \u03bbem \u2248 460 nm, in which both ICT and ESIPT processes were not present. As temperature was warmed up (to about \u221290 \u00b0C), ICT process became gradually allowed and emission was shifted to \u03bbem \u2248 510 nm, which was attributed to the normal form N* of flavonoid.

As a result of these studies, several analogues of the coumarin family of antibiotics have been reported and shown to exhibit increased Hsp90 inhibitory activity; however, the monomeric species lacked the ability to manifest anti-proliferative activity against cancer cell lines at concentrations tested. In an effort to develop more efficacious compounds that produce growth inhibitory activity against cancer cell lines, structure\u2212activity relationships were investigated surrounding the prenylated benzamide side chain of the natural product.

The calculations comprise a large number of, both singlet and triplet, valence and Rydberg excited states. A newly developed continuum model has been used to compute solvatochromic shifts. In the gas phase the first and second \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excited singlet valence states of imidazole are computed at 6.72 and 7.15 eV, and they shift to 6.32 and 6.53 eV upon solvation. The gas-phase values are somewhat too large (\u22480.3 eV) due to an erroneous valence\u2212Rydberg mixing in the CASSCF wave function. The first and second \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excited singlet valence states of the imidazolium ion are computed at 5.72 and 6.94 eV in the gas phase and shifted to 5.86 and 6.83 eV in aqueous solutions. The present results are in agreement with the observed absorption band maxima in aqueous solution, 6.0 and 6.5 eV for imidazole and 6.0 and 6.9 eV for the imidazolium ion. The computed intensities suggest another possible (but less probable) interpretation of the solution spectrum, where both species are simultaneously present. In this case the lowest band at 6.0 eV is assigned to a transition to the 2 1A1 state in protonated imidazole, while the second band observed in neutral solution at 6.5 eV corresponds to excitation to the 31A\u2018 state in imidazole.

The reaction of N,N\u2018-bis(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl)dibenzofuran-4,6-diamine (iPrLH2) with excess ZnR2 (R = Et, Me) in toluene solution forms the dizinc derivatives iPrLZn2Et2 (1) and iPrLZn2Me2 (2), which were isolated in 69% and 72% yields, respectively. Both 1 and 2 feature three-coordinate zinc centers in the solid state. Reaction of 2 equiv of ZnPh2 with N,N\u2018-bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)dibenzofuran-4,6-diamine (MeLH2) forms MeLZn2Ph2 (3), which was isolated in 73% yield. The analogous reaction using iPrLH2 instead of MeLH2 forms iPrLZn2Ph2 (4), which was isolated in 56% yield. The solid-state structure of 3 (two independent molecules) reveals a parallelogram-shaped [Zn2(\u03bc-Ph)2]2+ core, with the overall molecule having approximate (noncrystallographic) C2 symmetry and a short intermetal separation (2.7279(6) and 2.7809(6) \u00c5). In contrast, the 1H NMR spectrum of 3 (CD2Cl2) indicates overall C2v symmetry; this is likely due to cleavage of the phenyl bridges in solution. The solid-state structure of 4, which features the bulkier iPr-substituted ligand, reveals the absence of Ph bridges. Instead, each molecule of 4 has a pair of essentially noninteracting three-coordinate Zn centers. Benzene solutions of 3 react with 1 equiv of benzaldehyde to form the addition product MeLZn2(Ph)(OCHPh2) (5) in 87% isolated yield. The solid-state structure of 5 reveals a symmetric and puckered [Zn2(\u03bc-Ph)(\u03bc-OCHPh2)]2+ core with a short Zn\u2212Zn separation of 2.6977(13) \u00c5. In CD2Cl2 solution, the Ph bridge of 5 undergoes reversible cleavage. This process followed by rotation about the Zn\u2212Ph bond leads to exchange of the inequivalent ortho (and meta) protons of the \u03bc-Ph ligand. Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopic data indicates that this exchange occurs with \u0394G\u29e7 = 11.5(1) kcal mol-1 (\u221250 \u00b0C). At 70 \u00b0C, benzene solutions of 5 react with 1 equiv of benzaldehyde to form the double-addition product MeLZn2(OCHPh2)2 (6) in 67% isolated yield.

In this study, a membrane-spanning domain has been identified in PFO by a combination of fluorescence spectroscopic methods using the fluorescent dye N,N\u2018-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N\u2018-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl)ethylenediamine (NBD) whose emission properties are sensitive to water. PFO was substituted with a single cysteine at most of the residues between amino acids K189 and N218, and then each cysteine was modified with NBD. Each purified NBD-labeled PFO was then bound to membranes, and the probe's environment was ascertained by measuring its fluorescence lifetime, emission intensity, and collisional quenching with either aqueous (iodide ions) or nonaqueous (nitroxide-labeled phospholipids) quenchers. Lifetime and intensity measurements revealed that the amino acid side chains in this region of the membrane-bound PFO polypeptide alternated between being in an aqueous or a nonaqueous environment. This pattern indicates that this portion of the membrane-bound PFO spans the membrane in an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet conformation. The alternating exposure of these residues to the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer was demonstrated by their susceptibility to quenching by nitroxide moieties attached to phospholipid acyl chains. Residues K189\u2212N218 therefore form a two-stranded, amphipathic \u03b2-sheet in the membrane-bound PFO that creates a stable interface between the pore and the membrane. This same region packs as three short \u03b1-helices in the soluble, monomeric form of PFO, and therefore, the cholesterol-dependent conversion of PFO to a membrane-bound oligomer involves a major structural transition in which three \u03b1-helices unfold to form a membrane-spanning amphipathic \u03b2-sheet.

It is shown that electrodes with very small electroactive areas simplify the study of the nucleation and growth mechanism involved in electrodeposition. Reducing the electroactive area of the substrate easily controls the number of nucleation sites. With the use of substrates having electroactive radii of a few nanometers, it is possible to form only one single growth center and to allow that center to grow independently. The current transient associated with the growth of such a single nucleus provides both kinetic and mechanistic information about the electrodeposition process. A mathematical formula for the current transient under combined electrokinetic and mass-transport control based on the work of Fletcher [J. Cryst. Growth 1983, 62, 505] and Kruijt et al. [J. Electroanal. Chem. 1994, 371, 13] is used to fit the transients to extract the exchange current density and diffusion coefficient of the reactants. For the Pt on carbon deposition process at low overpotentials, for which the electron-transfer steps control the overall deposition process, single nucleation is observed when the electrode is smaller than about 5 nm in size. It is found that the single nucleation and growth processes can also occur at relatively large electrodes (\u223c100 nm in size) when a high overpotential is applied so that a diffusion-controlled deposition process is established. Such a phenomenon is analyzed in terms of the depletion layer of electroactive species around the growing nucleus, and the effect that this has on the nucleation rate on the surrounding electrode surface.

GABA-Snifit is a semisynthetic fusion protein containing the GABAB receptor, SNAP- and CLIP-tag, a synthetic fluorophore and a fluorescent GABAB receptor antagonist. When assembled on cell surfaces, GABA-Snifit displays a GABA-dependent fluorescence emission spectrum in the range of 500\u2013700 nm that permits sensing micromolar to millimolar GABA concentrations. The ratiometric change of the sensor on living cells is 1.8.

In liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, formidable analytical challenges remain in removing the nonbiological factors that affect chromatographic peak areas. These factors include sample matrix-induced ion suppression, chromatographic quality, and analytical drift. The combination of these factors is referred to as obscuring variation. Some metabolomics samples can exhibit intense obscuring variation due to matrix-induced ion suppression, rendering large amounts of data unreliable and difficult to interpret. Existing normalization techniques have limited applicability to these sample types. Here we present a data normalization method to minimize the effects of obscuring variation. We normalize peak areas using a batch-specific normalization process, which matches measured metabolites with isotope-labeled internal standards that behave similarly during the analysis. This method, called best-matched internal standard (B-MIS) normalization, can be applied to targeted or untargeted metabolomics data sets and yields relative concentrations. We evaluate and demonstrate the utility of B-MIS normalization using marine environmental samples and laboratory grown cultures of phytoplankton. In untargeted analyses, B-MIS normalization allowed for inclusion of mass features in downstream analyses that would have been considered unreliable without normalization due to obscuring variation.

The volume of solvent gelled by a given amount of the gelator was observed to depend upon the volume of added water. The gelation behavior of the amphiphiles in a given solvent containing a known volume of water was compared. The effects of chirality and substitution on the acid group on the gelation ability were examined. Although the corresponding N-(n-tetradecylcarbamoyl)-dl-alanine was found to form only weak organogel in pure solvents, the achiral amphiphilic compound N-(n-tetradecylcarbamoyl)-\u03b2-alanine, however, did not form gel in the absence of water. The methyl ester of N-(n-tetradecylcarbamoyl)-l-alanine was also observed to form gels in the same solvents, but only in the presence of water. The organogels were characterized by several techniques, including 1H NMR, Fourier transform IR, X-ray diffraction, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The thermal and rheological properties of the organogels were studied.

This review will use a SWOT analysis model to discuss some of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that are apparent to an investigator venturing into this relatively new field. SWOT has been used extensively in business settings to uncover new outlooks and identify problems that would impede progress. The field of environmental metabolomics provides great opportunities for discovery, and this is recognized by a high level of interest in potential applications. However, understanding the biological consequence of environmental exposures can be confounded by inter- and intra-individual differences. Metabolomic profiles can yield a plethora of data, the interpretation of which is complex and still being evaluated and researched. The development of the field will depend on the availability of technologies for data handling and that permit ready access metabolomic databases. Understanding the relevance of metabolomic endpoints to organism health vs adaptation vs variation is an important step in understanding what constitutes a substantive environmental threat. Metabolomic applications in reproductive research are discussed. Overall, the development of a comprehensive mechanistic-based interpretation of metabolomic changes offers the possibility of providing information that will significantly contribute to the protection of human health and the environment.

SIRT-subtype-specific defatty-acylase activity modulators are needed for detailed investigation of the biological roles of these enzymes, and to find suitable small molecules, we require appropriate screening systems. Here, we designed and synthesized a set of SIRT defatty-acylase activity probes with various quencher moieties and peptide sequences based on our previously developed one-step FRET-based SIRT probe SFP3, using improved methodology. Scanning of this set of probes with SIRT isozymes revealed that certain probe\/isozyme combinations showed especially high responses. To illustrate the utility of the combinations thus identified, we applied compound 18\/SIRT2 for inhibitor screening of a large chemical library. This enabled us to discover a new small molecule SIRT2-specific defatty-acylase inhibitor."},{"title":"Solution Structure of a 2:1 Quindoline\u2013c-MYC G-Quadruplex: Insights into G-Quadruplex-Interactive Small Molecule Drug Design","abstract":"Unimolecular parallel-stranded G-quadruplex structures are found to be prevalent in gene promoters.

The exocyclic methylene group in 3b is more efficient in gating the intraTTET than it is in 3a (\u03a6TTET = 0.08 vs 0.71, respectively). This higher level of gating that occurs in 3b is attributed to a much shorter lifetime of the axial DPSO triplet, caused by an efficient through-space intraTTET from the axial DPSO group to the C6 exocyclic olefin.

These reactions are first order in thiol and first order in cluster 1 with appreciable negative entropies of activation. These data suggest that the rate determining step of the desulfurization reaction is the initial association of the thiol to the cluster. The more nucleophilic thiolate anions react with 1 at \u221240 \u00b0C to form an adduct in which the thiolate anion is bound \u03b71 to the Co atom. At \u221225 \u00b0C, the initial adduct rearranges to a fluxional \u03bc2, \u03b71-bound thiolate.

Transepithelial permeation was assessed using monolayers of the Caco-2 cell culture model, and effects on Caco-2 cellular viability kinetics were evaluated by using the Real-Time-GLO assay as well as by microscopy following Tryphan blue staining. Morphological Caco-2 cell changes were studied exploiting the impedance-based xCELLigence system as well as optically using the oCelloscope setup. Finally, the effect of pH on the folding propensity of the PTH(1-34)\u2013penetratin conjugate and its ability to disrupt lipid membranes were assessed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and the calcein release assay, respectively. The transepithelial PTH(1-34) permeation was not pH-dependent when applying the coadministration approach. However, by applying the conjugation approach, the PTH(1-34) permeation was significantly enhanced by lowering the pH from 7.4 to 5 but also associated with a compromised barrier and a lowering of the cellular viability. The negative effects on the cellular viability following cellular incubation with the PTH(1-34)\u2013penetratin conjugate were moreover confirmed during real-time monitoring of the Caco-2 cell viability as well as by enhanced Tryphan blue uptake. In addition, morphological changes were primarily observed for cells incubated with the PTH(1-34)\u2013penetratin conjugate at pH 5, which was moreover demonstrated to have an enhanced membrane permeating effect following lowering of the pH from 7.4 to 5.

The substrates are lanthanide ions in 0.001\u22128 M HCl and HNO3 solutions. The results fall into three regions of acid concentration: low, mid, and high. In HCl, distribution coefficients are low in 0.001 to 2 M, increase in 4 and 6 M, and then decrease in 8 M HCl. In the low-acid region, the metal ion remains with its waters of hydration and does not coordinate to the carbonyl oxygens. As the acid concentration exceeds 2 M, protonation of the amide occurs to form an iminium moiety, electrostatically attracting the anionic lanthanide complex through ion-exchange and releasing waters of hydration. At high acid concentration, the apparent affinity decreases due to competition by the large excess of chloride ions for the ion-exchange sites. The affinity sequence in 6 M HCl is Tb &gt; Dy &gt; Eu &gt; Gd &gt; Ho &gt; Sm &gt; Er &gt; Tm &gt; Yb &gt; Lu &gt; Nd &gt; Ce &gt; La.

It was found that adsorption of the polymers on the surfaces of cocrystals might prevent the precipitation of the parent drug and alter the dissolution rate. The effect of polymers on precipitation could be determined by the cocrystal dissolution rate, the interactions of polymers with the surfaces of cocrystals, the characters of the noncovalent bonds formed between the polymers and the cocrystal surfaces, and the mobility and conformation of the polymers. The etching experiments of single cocrystals revealed that FFA-NIC and CBZ-NIC appeared as surface precipitation cocrystals while FFA-TP could lead to bulk precipitation. Both PVP and PVP-VA were good precipitation inhibitors for FFA-NIC, and they could completely inhibit the recrystallization of FFA III on the surfaces of dissolving cocrystals. In addition, as the adsorption of the polymer was slower than dissolution rate of the cocrystals, PVP and PVP-VA could only partially inhibit the recrystallization of CBZ dihydrate on the surface of CBZ-NIC. While PEG had no inhibitory effect on the surface crystallization of FFA-NIC and CBZ-NIC, due to its weak interactions with the surfaces of the cocrystals, it enhanced the dissolution performance of FFA-TP. In contrast, PVP and PVP-VA reduced the dissolution rate of FFA-TP and subsequently undermined the performance of cocrystals. Taken together, the approach of combining experimental and molecular dynamics simulation provided insights into the mechanisms of cocrystal dissolution as well as the polymers acting as inhibitory excipients for precipitation\/recrystallization, making contribution to the development of novel formulations."},{"title":"An Effective Topological Symmetry Perception and Unique Numbering Algorithm","abstract":"Determination of equivalence classes of atoms in molecules and the unique numbering for the molecular graphs are of major interest for many structure processing tasks and many programs have been reported for this purpose.

In order to avoid the failures of partitioning and the time-consuming atom-by-atom matching, on the basis of a profound analysis on the mechanism of Morgan algorithm, this work proposed two improvements for the original Morgan algorithm. The first improvement is to avoid the oscillatory behavior of Morgan algorithm. The second improvement referred to as single-vertex Morgan algorithm, is to decompose the Morgan algorithm into single-vertex processing. By incorporating these improvements, an effective topological symmetry perception and unique numbering algorithms were devised.

However, its molecular mechanism remains still unknown. To investigate such film formation mechanism, we performed the atomistic reaction simulations in acetonitrile (AN)-based electrolyte solutions using the Red Moon method (a hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)\/molecular dynamics (MD) reaction method). The present simulations were able to successfully reproduce the experimental observations where the reaction products produced by the reduction of salts mainly form the SEI film in the HC electrolyte. Further, it was revealed that such stable SEI film can be formed in a stepwise fashion: (i) the diffusive transfer of reduction products, (ii) the Li salt-based passivation film formation, and (iii) the formation of the solvent-based film layer.

This reaction provides capped oligoribonucleotides, which function as primers for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. The endonuclease reaction is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. We have used a number of divalent and trivalent metal ions alone and in combination to probe the mechanism of RNA cleavage by the influenza virus endonuclease. Virus-specific cleavage was observed with various metal ions, and maximum cleavage activity was obtained with 100 \u03bcM Mn2+ or 100 \u03bcM Co2+. This activity was about 2-fold higher than that observed with Mg2+ at the optimal concentration of 1 mM. Activity dependence on metal ion concentration was cooperative with Hill coefficients close to or larger than 2. Synergistic activation of cleavage activity was observed with combinations of different metal ions at varying concentrations. These results support a two-metal ion mechanism of RNA cleavage for the influenza virus cap-dependent endonuclease.

The composition and structure of hydrolyzed samples (HPAN) were determined using 13C NMR spectrometry. The HPAN are multiblock copolymers containing acrylonitrile (A) and acrylamide (B) units. A set of individual rate constants for the reaction of central A units in AAA, AAB + BAA, and BAB triads, k0, k1, and k2, respectively, describes fairly well both the reaction kinetics and the HPAN distribution of units. Thus, the accelerating effect of neighboring groups (k0:k1:k2 = 1:18:36) is the principal, if not exclusive, factor determining the peculiarities of the acidic PAN hydrolysis. Less than 3% of acrylamide groups are involved in cyclization (formation of glutarimide cycles) under the hydrolysis conditions used, so that cyclization may be neglected in the analysis of the hydrolysis kinetics and the HPAN structure within the framework of the neighbor effect.

The surfaces of MWNTs were modified with octadecylamine (ODA) via CF4 plasma-assisted fluorination and subsequent alkylamination. The number of fluorine groups on the MWNT surface was controlled by varying the CF4 plasma treatment conditions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that reaction of the fluorinated MWNTs and octadecylamine (ODA) was strongly affected by solvent quality and reaction temperature. The resulting MWNT\/PP nanocomposites exhibited a much finer dispersion in the insulating PP matrix than was observed for nonmodified MWNTs, leading to an enhanced electrical conductance at low MWNT loading (2 wt %). Furthermore, the nanocomposites showed significantly improved mechanical properties; the storage modulus (G\u2032) and complex viscosity (\u03b7*) increased significantly in the low-frequency region as MWNT loading was increased, showing a rheological percolation threshold at 1 wt % MWNT loading. This effective method can be applied to the fabrication of other carbon nanotube-based polymer nanocomposites for potential development into electrostatic dissipative (ESD) materials with high mechanical strength and for other high-performance industrial applications."},{"title":"Modulation of Cell Differentiation, Proliferation, and Tumor Growth by Dihydrobenzyloxopyrimidine Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors","abstract":"A series of 5-alkyl-2-(alkylthio)-6-(1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)propyl)-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives (3a\u2013h) belonging to the F2-DABOs class of non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are endowed with a strong antiproliferative effect and induce cytodifferentiation in A375 melanoma cells. Among tested compounds, the most potent is 3g (SPV122), which also induces apoptosis in a cell-density-dependent manner and antagonizes tumor growth in animal models. All these effects are similar or even more pronounced than those previously reported for other nucleoside or non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase or by functional knockout of the reverse-transcriptase-encoding long interspersed element 1 by RNA interference (RNAi). Taken together with our previously reported results, these data further confirm our idea that cellular alterations induced by NNRTIs are a consequence of the inhibition of the endogenous reverse transcriptase in A375 cells and support the potential of NNRTIs as valuable agents in cancer therapy."},{"title":"Experimental Data Assessment Test for Composition of Vapor Phase in Equilibrium with Gas Hydrate and Liquid Water for Carbon Dioxide + Methane or Nitrogen + Water System","abstract":"Accurate knowledge of the compositions of the equilibrium phases in the systems containing gas hydrates is essential for many hydrate-based separation processes. Unfortunately, there are limited sets of such experimental data available in the literature partly due to the difficulties in measurements of the compositions of the phases in equilibrium with gas hydrate. Consequently, satisfactory accuracy of the measurements may not be obvious. Therefore, reliability of the corresponding data should be checked prior to their further applications. In this article, we present a thermodynamic assessment test (consistency test) based on the area test approach for the experimental compositional data of vapor phase in equilibrium with gas hydrate + liquid water for the carbon dioxide + methane or nitrogen + water system. The van der Waals and Platteeuw (vdW-P) solid solution theory is used to model the hydrate phase, and the Valderrama\u2013Patel\u2013Teja equation of state (VPT-EoS) along with the nondensity dependent (NDD) mixing rule is applied to deal with the fluid phases. The results show that only one of the studied experimental data sets seems to be thermodynamically consistent, and the rest of the data seem to be either not fully consistent or inconsistent."},{"title":"Influence of the Operating Parameters on the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NO with Hydrocarbons Using Cu-Ion-Exchanged Titanium-Pillared Interlayer Clays (Ti-PILCs)","abstract":"Recently, the suitability of titanium-pillared clays as catalyst supports has been explored, because of their interesting physical properties. In this work, we have studied the influence of the operating parameters on the selective catalytic reduction of NO by propylene over a characterized Cu-ion-exchanged titanium-pillared interlayer clays (Ti-PILCs). NO reduction was favored by a C3H6 concentration increase when the combustion of this hydrocarbon was complete. NO reduction was observed to be promoted by a small amount of oxygen when the oxygen concentration was less than that required for complete C3H6 combustion (critical oxygen concentration). For oxygen concentrations higher than this critical value, the effect of oxygen concentration was different, depending on the reaction temperature, compared to that corresponding to the maximum NO conversion. Two different rate-limiting steps exist in the SCR\u2212NO, when Cu-Ti-PILCs are used as catalysts, depending on the reaction temperature:\u2009 surface reaction control at low temperatures and external mass-transfer control at high temperatures.

This study revealed the role or effect of surface chemistry of the solid substrate in mechanochemical polymerization reactions. As a model reactant, \u03b1-pinene was chosen because it was known to readily form tribopolymers at the sliding interface of stainless steel under vapor-phase lubrication conditions. Eight different substrate materials were tested\u2014palladium, nickel, copper, stainless steel, gold, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, and diamond-like carbon (DLC). All metal substrates and DLC were initially covered with surface oxide species formed naturally in air or during the oxidative sample cleaning. It was found that the tribopolymerization yield of \u03b1-pinene is much higher on the substrates that can chemisorb \u03b1-pinene, compared to the ones on which only physisorption occurs. From the load dependence of the tribopolymerization yield, it was found that the surfaces capable of chemisorption give a smaller critical activation volume for the mechanochemical reaction, compared to the ones capable of physisorption only. On the basis of these observations and infrared spectroscopy analyses of the adsorbed molecules and the produced polymers, it was concluded that the mechanochemical reaction mechanisms might be different between chemically reactive and inert surfaces and that the chemical reactivity of the substrate surface greatly influences the tribochemical polymerization reactions of adsorbed molecules."},{"title":"Molecular-Level Design of a Photoinduced Magnetic Spin Coupling System:\u2009 Nickel Nitroprusside","abstract":"Rational design of a magnetic material (nickel nitroprusside) at the molecular level allowed switching of a spin coupling by means of photoinduced metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT).

The newly appearing spin on Fe orders the spins on the nearest Ni2+ ions around Fe. In other words, one MLCT aligns five spin sources resulting in the formation of magnetic clusters with S = 5. Furthermore, such a photoinduced spin ordering can be rerandomized by thermal treatment.

Polymers with different cluster loadings exhibit the characteristic broad band emission of Mo6Cl12 at \u03bbmax = 765 \u00b1 3 nm, and luminescence decays are composed of short- and long-lifetime components, which are consistent with the presence of cis- and trans-disubstituted cluster species, respectively. The lifetime of the cis form is too short to permit its bimolecular reaction with oxygen. However, the long-lifetime component is quenched efficiently by O2, and Stern\u2212Volmer analyses of emission lifetimes yield quenching rate constants of (2\u221210) \u00d7 105 M-1 s-1 for cluster loadings in the range (3.5\u22120.3) \u00d7 10-3 g\/g of PVP, respectively. The quenching rate constant increases to \u223c50 \u00d7 105 M-1 s-1 for all polymers in MeOH regardless of cluster loading. In aqueous solutions (pH 3\u22126) intermediate quenching rate constants are observed. These results correlate with the swelling properties of the PVP polymer in various solvents where greater swelling is manifested in greater accessibility of oxygen to the cluster active site and hence increased quenching rate constants. Oxygenated solutions of PVP-Mo6Cl12 and alkenes photoreact to yield oxidized olefins. The products and product distributions indicate an energy transfer quenching reaction between oxygen and electronically excited polymer-bound clusters to produce singlet oxygen.

DO sensor designs can employ selectively permeable membranes to isolate DO from untargeted compounds or organisms in waterbodies. Hence, the DO concentration can be monitored and the health of the water can be evaluated over time. However, the presence of bacteria in natural waterbodies can lead to the formation of biofilms that can block pores and prevent analyte from permeating the membrane, resulting in inaccurate readings. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of a fluorosilane-based omniphobic lubricant-infused (OLI) coating on a selectively permeable membrane and investigate the rate of biofilm formation for a commercially available DO sensor. Coated and unmodified membranes were incubated in an environment undergoing accelerated bacterial growth, and the change in sensitivity was evaluated after 40, 100, 250, and 500 h. Our findings show that the OLI membranes attenuate biofouling by 70% and maintain sensitivity after 3 weeks of incubation, further demonstrating that oxygen transfer through the OLI coating is achievable. Meanwhile, unmodified membranes exhibit significant biofouling that results in a 3.35 higher rate of decay in oxygen measurement sensitivity and an over 70% decrease in static contact angle. These results show that the OLI coating can be applied on commercially available membranes to prevent biofouling. Therefore, OLI coatings are a suitable candidate to suppress biofilm formation in the widespread use of selectively permeable membranes for environmental, medical, and fluid separation applications."},{"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Selenium\u2212Carbon Nanocables","abstract":"In this letter, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel Se\u2212C hybrid nanostructure.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy was used to access the properties of both the carbon nanotubes and selenium. The behavior of the radial breathing mode and the G-band indicates that the Se shell primarily covers semiconducting nanotubes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the nanocables have a thin coverage of seleniun oxide.

It has been known for some time that carbonic acid can be separated from strong acids by ion chromatography in the exclusion mode (ICE) using only water as the eluent. The practice of water ICE was shown feasible for very weak acids like silicate and borate with a dedicated element specific detector like an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS), but this is rarely practical in most laboratories. Direct conductometric detection is possible for H2CO3 but because of its weak nature, not especially sensitive; complex multistep ion exchange methods do not markedly improve this LOD. It will clearly be impractical in acids that are weaker still. By using a permeative amine introduction device (PAID,  Anal. Chem. 2016, 88, 2198\u20132204) as a conductometric developing agent, we demonstrate that a variety of weak acids (silicate, borate, arsenite, cyanide, carbonate, and sulfide) cannot only be separated on an ion exclusion column, they can be sensitively detected (LODs 0.2\u20130.4 \u03bcM). We observe that the elution order is essentially the same as that on a nonfunctionalized poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) column using 1\u201310% acetonitrile as eluent and follows the reverse order of the polar surface area (PSA) of the analyte molecules. PSA values have been widely used to predict biological transport of pharmaceuticals across a membrane but never to predict chromatographic behavior. We demonstrate the application of the technique by measuring the silicate and borate depth profiles in the Pacific Ocean; the silicate results show an excellent match with results from a reference laboratory."},{"title":"Designed Surface with Tunable IgG Density as an <i>in Vitro<\/i> Model for Immune Complex Mediated Stimulation of Leukocytes","abstract":"We present the design of an in vitro model for immune-complex-mediated stimulation of leukocytes and its functional characteristics with respect to monocyte adhesion.

The peptide was linked to neutravidin covalently attached to a mixed self-assembled monolayer of carboxyl- and methoxy-terminated oligo(ethylene glycol) alkane thiolates on gold. The surface adhesion propensity of human monocytes (cell line U937) was highly dependent on the lateral IgG density and indicated that there exists a distance between IgG-Fc on the surface where interactions with Fc\u03b3 receptors are optimal.

Chronic constant light exposure effectively disrupts circadian rhythm in rats. On the basis of previous publications, we hypothesized that chronic constant light exposure might contribute significantly to development of AD-like-phenotype in rats and that fluoxetine (Flx) treatment might protect the brain against it. Adult male rats were exposed to normal light-dark cycles, constant light (LL), constant dark, and LL+Flx (5 mg\/kg\/day, ZT5) for four months. The expression of molecular markers of circadian rhythm: Per2 transcripts; and protein expression of peroxiredoxin-1 (PRX1) and hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (PRX-SO2\/3) were significantly dysregulated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of LL rats, which was prevented with concomitant fluoxetine administration. The levels of glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid were dysregulated, and oxidative damage was observed in the SCN and hippocampi of LL rats. Fluoxetine treatment conferred protection against oxidative damage in LL rats. Constant light exposure also impaired rats\u2019 performance on Y-maze, Morris maze, and novel object recognition test, which was prevented with fluoxetine administration. A significant elevation in soluble A\u03b21\u201342 levels, which strongly correlated with upregulation of Bace1 and Mgat3 transcripts was observed in the hippocampus of LL rats. Further, the expression of antiaging gene Sirt1 was downregulated, and neuronal damage indicator Prokr2 was upregulated in hippocampus. Fluoxetine rescued A\u03b21\u201342 upregulation and AD-related genes\u2019 dysregulation.

Effluents from two WWTPs were used in the experiments. For the bioassays, EON was added to water from four salinities (\u223c0 to 30) collected from the James River (VA) in August 2008, and then concentrations of N and phosphorus compounds were measured periodically over 48 h. Bioassay results, based on changes in DON concentrations, indicate that some fraction of the EON was removed and that the degree of EON removal varied between effluents and with salinity. Further, we caution that bioassay results should be interpreted within a broad context of detailed information on chemical characterization. EON from both WWTPs was also photoreactive, with labile NH4+ and dissolved primary amines released during exposure to sunlight. We also present the first data that demonstrate that when EON is exposed to higher salinities, increasing amounts of NH4+ are released, further facilitating EON use as effluent transits from freshwater through estuaries to the coast."},{"title":"Thermal Atomic Layer Etching of Aluminum Oxide (Al<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>3<\/sub>) Using Sequential Exposures of Niobium Pentafluoride (NbF<sub>5<\/sub>) and Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4<\/sub>): A Combined Experimental and Density Functional Theory Study of the Etch Mechanism","abstract":"Thermal atomic layer etching (ALEt) of amorphous Al2O3 was performed by alternate exposures of niobium pentafluoride (NbF5) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).

The maximum etch rate of about 1.4 \u00c5\/cycle and a linear increase of the removed film thickness with the number of etch cycles were obtained at a temperature of 460 \u00b0C. With the help of density functional theory calculations, an etch mechanism is proposed where NbF5 converts part of the Al2O3 surface into an AlF3 or aluminum oxyfluoride layer, which upon reacting with CCl4 is converted into volatile halide-containing byproducts, thus etching away the converted portion of the material. Consistent with this, a significant surface fluorine content of about 55 at. % was revealed when the elemental depth profile analysis of a thick NbF5-treated Al2O3 layer was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface morphology of the reference, pre-, and postetch Al2O3 surfaces was analyzed using atomic force microscopy and bright-field transmission electron microscopy.

First, the formal relationship between the ionic activity coefficients in the membrane and the membrane effective charge concentration is established by comparing the results obtained from a model based on the ideal Donnan equilibrium extended to account for the ion pairing effect with the results obtained from a thermodynamic formalism including ionic activities instead of concentrations. Second, we calculate the membrane effective charge concentration and the ionic activity coefficients by using a simple model of ion pairing based on the Fuoss approach for contact ion pairs in electrolyte solutions with a correction term for the entropy change of the counterion undergoing ion pairing. Finally, we study the activity coefficients effects on the co-ion exclusion in the charged membrane as a function of the external salt concentration.

In this paper, we analyze the basis for the extraordinarily high stereoselectivity and broad substrate scope observed in the HKR. We demonstrate that the stereochemistry of each of the two (salen)Co(III) complexes in the rate-determining transition structure is important for productive catalysis: a measurable rate of hydrolysis occurs only if the absolute stereochemistry of each of these (salen)Co(III) complexes is the same. Experimental and computational studies provide strong evidence that stereochemical communication in the HKR is mediated by the stepped conformation of the salen ligand, and not the shape of the chiral diamine backbone of the ligand. A detailed computational analysis reveals that the epoxide binds the Lewis acidic Co(III) complex in a well-defined geometry imposed by stereoelectronic rather than steric effects. This insight serves as the basis of a complete stereochemical and transition structure model that sheds light on the reasons for the broad substrate generality of the HKR."},{"title":"Adsorptive Removal of Dibenzothiophene and Dibenzothiophene Sulfone over Mesoporous Materials","abstract":"Dibenzothiophene (DBT, a typical sulfur compound) and dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTO2, an oxidation product of DBT) were chosen as the model compounds, and their adsorption over a mesoporous silica (MCM-41) and a mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) were conducted under the exact same conditions. The adsorption amounts of DBTO2 over both adsorbents were enhanced compared to the DBT adsorption amounts, which clearly demonstrated that a combination of oxidation and adsorption is better than direct adsorption to achieve a better desulfurization performance. Besides, it was found that CMK-3 performed better for DBT removal compared to MCM-41, but the adsorption amount of DBTO2 over MCM-41 exceeded the corresponding value over CMK-3 (1.60 vs 0.88 mgS\/g in p-xylene). Moreover, model fuels with varied hydrocarbon compositions were employed to investigate the impact of arene amounts. Finally, jet and diesel fuels were oxidized and treated with MCM-41, resulting in 85.6% and 81.4% sulfur removal, respectively. In contrast, when the fuels were directly treated with MCM-41, the corresponding sulfur removal amounts were only 19.8% and 40.9%. The results with real fuels further verified the necessity of the oxidation process.

This is demonstrated here on the basis of functionalized transparent mesoporous silica thin films prepared on the indium\u2013tin oxide electrode from the combination of an electrochemically induced self-assembly method (to generate azide-functionalized silica) and a copper-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne click reaction (to derivatize the material with electroactive groups). The very small thickness (105 nm) and the uniformly distributed vertical mesochannels with ultranarrow diameter (2 nm) make the hybrid film a promising substrate that not only achieves a transparency of 82% but also provides large surface area to accommodate a high density of redox active species such as ferrocene. In such rigid and insulating porous membranes, the charge transfer reactions take place through a pure electron-hopping mechanism between adjacent redox sites, which are favored by the ordered and oriented mesostructure containing large amounts of uniformly distributed ferrocene functions in the mesochannels. Their performance results from both high charge transfer rates (electron hopping) and easy mass transport (fast diffusion of counter ions). The most effective system is the ferrocene-functionalized silica film prepared from 40% organosilane, which is able to deliver a capacity of 105 C cm\u20133 (1.10 mC cm\u20132) at a current density of 0.4 A cm\u20133 (with up to 48% capacity retention achieved at a charging time as short as 2.8 s).

The basis set effects have been further assessed. This study shows that the determination of the second hyperpolarizability with the CCSD method provides results in closest agreement with the CCSD(T) reference values. The use of MP2 level of theory performs well for the closed-shell compound but not for open-shell ones. Spin-projection UMP3 and UMP4 methods reproduce well UCCSD(T) values for the p-quinodimethane but not for the charged compound.

However, because of their seasonal production, regional specific cultivation, and perishable nature, it is essential to develop preservation technologies to extend the postharvest shelf life of fresh fruits. Climacteric fruit adopt spoilage because of ethylene, a key hormone associated with the ripening process. Therefore, controlling ethylene activity by following safe and effective approaches is a key to extend the postharvest shelf life of fruit. In this review, ethylene control technologies will be discussed aiming for the need of developing more innovative and effective approaches. The biosynthesis pathway will be given first. Then, the technologies determining the postharvest shelf life of climacteric fruit will be described with special attention to the latest and significant published works in this field.

Part 2. Development of a PRF Kinetic Model Including 1,3-Cyclohexadiene Mechanism and Simulations of Ignition Control","abstract":"Autoignition control of fuel and air mixtures was simulated using an additive able to change its molecular structure upon light irradiation. This control was assumed to be feasible through the photochemical isomerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) to cis-1,3,5-hexatriene (1,3,5-HT). 1,3-CHD was present in a molar concentration of 1% in a PRF fuel and was transformed into 1,3,5-HT in varying amounts prior to ignition, in an attempt to control autoignition timing. The autoignition delays were calculated using a newly developed chemical kinetic mechanism for the low temperature combustion of PRF\/1,3-CHD\/1,3,5-HT mixtures in air. Validations for  PRF\/air mixtures were performed by simulations based on the new mechanism developed in the current work against ignition delay times (IDT) of the literature measured in rapid compression machines. The agreement between simulations and experiments for the pure compounds reinforced the accuracy of the mechanism, which led to an investigation of its impact on the IDTs for the addition of 1,3-CHD to PRF90. The computations showed that 1,3-CHD was an ignition enhancer, with a similar boosting effect to that of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate. Simulations predicted that the extent of ignition enhancing of 1,3-CHD can be controlled by the pressure because of the specific combustion chemistry that rules the ignition enhancing capacity of this compound. Additions of 1,3-CHD were found to promote the reactivity of a PRF90 to a greater extent than the addition of 1,3,5-HT. Simple single-zone modeling showed that ignition in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine may be controlled if the fuel is photochemically isomerized using light-irradiation prior to the combustion process."},{"title":"Complex Interactions with the Surroundings Dictate a Tagged Chain\u2019s Dynamics in Unentangled Polymer Melts","abstract":"For more than half a century the theoretical landscape for single chain dynamics for dense polymeric solutions and melts below the entanglement threshold has been dominated by the Rouse model for independent phantom chains, supported by ideas of hydrodynamic screening. There exists, however, a large body of literature from experiments, Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations on the deviations from the Rouse behavior for unentangled homopolymer melts, showcased mostly in the subdiffusive behavior of center-of-mass of tagged chains at intermediate times, with the subdiffusion exponent reported in the range 0.75\u20130.85. The influence of the surrounding chains of length Ns on the motion of a single tagged chain of length N is a key test, by which, through high-precision numerical simulation of unentangled melts, we show that the Rouse model fails. Our central results are that at intermediate times the tagged chain\u2019s center-of-mass moves subdiffusively, \u27e8\u0394r2cm\u27e9 \u221d t\u03b1 with subdiffusion exponent \u03b1 = 0.87 \u00b1 0.03 as opposed to \u03b1Rouse = 1, and that its crossover time to Fickian behavior is directly controlled by the relaxation time of the surrounding chains when the latter are shorter. The terminal relaxation time for the tagged chain and the long time diffusion coefficient are then sensitive to Ns. Both measured exponent flow, that is plots of d\u03b1(t)\/d ln (t) vs \u03b1(t) where \u03b1(t) is the effective exponent between \u27e8\u0394r2cm\u27e9 and t, and successful blob scaling arguments support the anomalous value of \u03b1 as a true exponent. We find the same exponent in the scaling of Rouse mode amplitude correlation functions and directly related exponent for the monomeric diffusion. We show that the consequences of these results on the dynamics of a tagged monomer and the chain\u2019s segmental orientation autocorrelation function agree very well with rheological measurements and NMR relaxometry experiments. We reflect back on a history of related experimental anomalies and discuss how a new theory might be developed."},{"title":"Density Scaling of the Structural and Johari\u2013Goldstein Secondary Relaxations in Poly(methyl methacrylate)","abstract":"Dielectric spectra were obtained on a low molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) over a range of temperatures (331 &lt; T (K) &lt; 386) at pressures approaching 0.8 GPa.

However, the Johari\u2013Goldstein (JG) relaxation times, \u03c4JG, do not conform to this density scaling for the same value of the exponent \u03b3. Likewise, the frequency separation of the \u03b1 and JG loss peaks in the spectrum increases with pressure for constant \u03c4\u03b1; that is, state points having the same \u03b1 relaxation time and same peak breadth have different \u03c4JG. Similar results were obtained on a lower molecular weight PMMA, for which there was less overlap of the two peaks.

Noticeably, the TEPA-MAPbI3\u2013xClx devices deliver high PCEs up to 19.73% which stands as the highest for MAPbI3\u2013xClx-based PSC. The environmental, thermal, and illumination stability also showed improvements ranging between 10%\u201330%.

The glass transition temperatures of poly(BA-co-SCMHB MA) increased in a linear fashion as the SCMHB MA content increased. Thermogravimetric analysis of the copolymers exhibited an onset of weight loss at 217 \u00b0C. Solution viscosity analysis indicated that SCMHB pendant polymers strongly aggregated in nonpolar solvents, such as toluene and CHCl3, and dissociated in polar solvents, such as THF. Based on melt rheological characterization, the melt viscosity of soluble SCMHB pendant polymers was an order of magnitude higher than that of PBA due to strong aggregation in the melt state. SCMHB pendant polymers exhibited thermoreversible characteristics, and complete dissociation in the melt state was observed at 80 \u00b0C, which was consistent with our earlier studies involving SCMHB-terminated poly(styrene) (PS), poly(isoprene) (PI), and PS-b-PI block copolymers. In addition, SCMHB units completely dissociated at 80 \u00b0C in toluene on the basis of 1H NMR measurements. The 90\u00b0 peel strength values for SCMHB-containing polymers increased as the SCMHB units increased due to the strong interaction of SCMHB units with the glass surface. Thin-layer chromatography indicated that the interaction of SCMHB pendant polymers with silica was more favorable compared to PBA homopolymer.

The hierarchical structure contributed to the high photocatalytic catalyst performance, which was investigated by controlling the morphologies of the mesopores and macropores. By optimizing the relative amounts of each component and the configuration of the composite, a TGM system was fabricated. The resulting TGM showed a lower extent of charge recombination and a higher photocurrent density, and hence a higher CO photoconversion rate (92.33 \u03bcmol CO\/g\u00b7h) than those of other composite combinations, i.e., bare TiO2, TiO2-graphene, TiO2-MoS2, and TiO2-graphene multiple-layered MoS2. Also, the role of each component and the underlying mechanism in the catalysis of the reaction by TGM were investigated. The long-term stability of the TGM composite was tested and compared with that of a TiO2-graphene-Ag composite. Over the course of 15 cycles, the TGM composite retained its original conversion rate, while the activity of the TiO2-graphene-Ag composite decreased.

Nevertheless an adiabatic formalism is often used in a zeroth-order description of the processes; for time-periodic perturbations the Floquet theory has been used within an adiabatic framework to provide a compact dynamical theory which requires a basis composed of only a small number of Floquet eigenstates. The use of the generalized Floquet theory or of the concept of a super-adiabatic basis allows the adiabatic approach to be further extended to handle systems with quasi-periodic Hamiltonians. The present work proposes a new approach, in which the time duration of the interaction is artificially prolonged and special absorbing boundary conditions are introduced asymptotically over the lengthened time interval in such a way as to force the adiabaticity of the process. The method involves what can be thought of as time-dependent optical potentials. Some trial applications to semiclassical inelastic collisions and to photodissociation effects have shown that the use of the new technique permits a description of the dynamical processes which is so economical that the use of a single generalized Floquet eigenvector will suffice. The main technical feature of this constrained adiabatic trajectory method is that it converts the problem of solving the TDSE with an explicitly time-dependent potential into that of solving a static complex eigenvalue problem.

A surface restricts the configurational space available to the pair of interacting molecules, thus changing the effective interactions between them. Because of this restriction, a surface can promote chiral separation of mixtures that are racemic in bulk. In this paper, we investigate chiral symmetry breaking induced by an achiral surface in a racemate. A parallel tempering Monte Carlo algorithm with tempering over the temperature domain is used to examine the interplay between molecular geometry and energetics in promoting chiral separations. The system is restricted to evolve in two dimensions. By controlling the balance between electrostatic and steric interactions, one can direct the surface assembly of the chiral molecules toward formation of small clusters of identical molecules. When molecular shape asymmetry is complemented by dipolar alignment, chiral micellar clusters of like molecules are assembled on the surface. We examine the case of small model molecules for which the two-dimensional restriction of the pair potential is sufficient to induce chiral segregation. An increase in molecular complexity can change the balance of intermolecular interactions to the point that heterochiral pairs are energetically more favored. In this case, we find conditions in which formation of homochiral micelles is still achieved, due to a combination of multibody and entropic effects. In such systems, an examination of the pair potential alone is insufficient to predict whether the multimolecular racemate will or will not segregate.

Here, poly(glycidol)-based nanogels (NGs) are proposed as delivery vehicles for antifungal agents for sustained drug release. NGs are formed by simple self-assembly of random copolymers, followed by oxidative cross-linking of thiol functionalities. We investigate the impact of copolymer amphiphilicity on NG interaction with mature fungal hyphae in order to select the optimal drug delivery system for model antifungal drug amphotericin B. The results show that drug-loaded NGs decrease minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for around four times and slow down the fungal biofilm synthesis at concentrations lower than MIC. Our results suggest that amphiphilicity of nanoparticle\u2019s polymer matrix is an important factor in understanding the action of nanocarriers toward fungal cells and should be considered in the development of nanoparticle-based antifungal therapy."},{"title":"pH-Dependent Lytic Peptides Discovered by Phage Display\u2020","abstract":"Lipid membranes compartmentalize eukaryotic cells and separate the cell interior from the extracellular milieu. So far, studies of peptide and protein interactions with membranes have largely been limited to naturally occurring peptides or to sequences designed on the basis of structural information and biophysical parameters. To expand on these studies, utilizing a system with minimal assumptions, we used phage-display technology to identify 12 amino acid-long peptides that bind to liposomes at pH 5.0 but not at pH 7.5. Of the nineteen peptides discovered, three were able to cause leakage of liposome contents. Multivalent presentation of these membrane-active peptides by conjugation onto poly(l-Lysine) enhanced their lytic potential. The secondary structures were analyzed by circular dichroism in aqueous 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and in buffered aqueous solutions, both in the presence and absence of liposomes. Two of the three lytic peptides show alpha helical profiles, whereas none of the nonlytic peptides formed stable secondary structures. The diverse characteristics of the peptides identified in this study demonstrate that phage-displayed peptide library screens on lipid membranes result in the discovery of nonclassical membrane-active peptides, whose study will provide novel insights into peptide\u2212membrane interactions.

Visible light activates the photocatalyst, and it acts as an electron-transfer reagent and helps in the fundamental organometallic steps by modulating the oxidation state of the cobalt complex.

The relevant thermodynamic parameters are usually obtained by employing spectroscopic and\/or calorimetric techniques and fitting an appropriate thermodynamic model to the experimental data. In this work, we compare the traditional approach of fitting the thermodynamic model to experimental data obtained from each experiment individually and the global approach of simultaneously fitting the model to all available data from different experiments. On the basis of several specific examples of DNA and protein unfolding, we demonstrate that piece-by-piece verification of the proposed thermodynamic model using individual fits is frequently inappropriate and can result in an incorrect mechanism and thermodynamics of the studied unfolding process. We find that while the two approaches are complementary in some aspects of analysis global fitting is essential for the appropriate selection and critical evaluation of the model mechanism. Only a good global fit thus gives us confidence that the obtained thermodynamic parameters of unfolding have real physical meaning."},{"title":"Homogeneous Metal Salt Solutions for Biomass Upgrading and Other Select Organic Reactions","abstract":"The growing interest in biomass as a renewable feedstock drives research toward innovative processes and performance-advantaged bioproducts. Homogeneous metal salt solutions are promising media owing to their diverse applications as Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acids, salting-in(out) agents, and solvents. Their multifaceted roles render them attractive but also complex to understand. Here, we aim at reviewing and analyzing the speciation of and the underlying mechanisms of metal salt catalysts by correlating the intrinsic properties of ions, obtained from spectroscopic and computational techniques, with experimental kinetics and the speciation\u2013property relations from dilute to very concentrated (molten salt) solutions. We focus on (1) metal salt speciation in dilute aqueous solutions with emphasis on the glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) tandem reaction, (2) salt\u2013solvent and salt\u2013substrate interactions in the reactive extraction of HMF and furfural from aqueous media into an organic solvent, (3) cation\u2013anion and salt\u2013substrate interactions, and the structure of the hydration sphere of cations during the dissolution of lignocellulosic biomass in molten salt hydrates (MSHs), (4) the activity of ions in solution, acidity, and speciation in the hydrolysis of cellulose in MSHs, (5) metal salt speciation in organic solvents and ionic liquids for the conversion of sugars to HMF and for further HMF upgrade, and (6) applications of metal salts in the Prins and Diels\u2013Alder reactions.

This approach is efficiently applied to receptor kinases that can be precisely, directly, and rapidly activated by some agent, such as a growth factor. However, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl lacks the experimental advantage of extracellular growth factors as immediate and direct stimuli.

However, for the majority of transition metal selenides, the potential windows have to compress to 0.5\u20133.0 V for the maintenance of cycling and rate capability, which largely sacrifices the capacity under low voltage and impair energy density for sodium full batteries. Herein, through introducing diverse metal ions, transition-metal selenides consisted of different composition doping (CoM\u2013Se2@NC, M = Ni, Cu, Zn) are prepared with more stable structures and higher conductivity, which exhibit superior cycling and rate properties than those of CoSe2@NC even at a wider voltage range for sodium ion batteries.

At equilibrium, two species are found in slow exchange. We observe that the deoxyribosylurea residue can be either intra- or extrahelical within structures which otherwise do not deviate strongly from that of a B-DNA as observed by NMR. Our study suggests that this is determined by the nature and number of hydrogen bonds which this residue can form as a function of two possible isomers. There are two possible structures for the urea side chain, either cis or trans for the urido bond which significantly changes the hydrogen bonding geometry of the residue. In the intrahelical species, the cis isomer can form two good hydrogen bonds with the bases on the opposite strand in the intrahelical species, A4 and C5, which is not the case for the trans isomer. This results in a kink in the helical axis. For the major extrahelical species, the situation is reversed. The trans isomer is able to form two good hydrogen bonds, with G13 on the same strand and A7 on the opposite strand. For the extrahelical species, the cis isomer can form only one hydrogen bond. In this major structure the NMR data show that the bases which are on either side of the deoxyribosylurea residue in the sequence, G14 and T16, are stacked over each other in a way similar to a normal B-DNA structure. This requires the formation of a loop for the backbone between these two residues. This loop can belong to one of two families, right- or left-handed. In a previous study of an abasic frameshift [Cuniasse et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2018\u22122026], a left-handed loop was observed, whereas in this study a right-handed loop is found for the first time in solution. The deoxyribosylurea residue lies in the minor groove and can form both an intra- and an interstrand hydrogen bond.

Polarization dependence of the effective depth radiating the terahertz waves due to the absorption anisotropy for terahertz waves allows us to distinguish domains in the inside and surface regions of the crystals. In an as-grown crystal, a large domain covering almost all the area is discerned in the inside region, while multidomains are discerned in the surface regions. We observed polarization switching via domain boundary motion in the direction perpendicular to the direction of hydrogen-bonded chains in the surface regions under an external electric field. Obtained images suggest that an uncharged 180\u00b0 domain wall (DW) parallel to the stacking plane of hydrogen-bonded chains covers the whole area at coercive fields. We argue that the DW dynamics stems from the anisotropic crystal structure, i.e., stacking of hydrogen-bonded chains."},{"title":"Thermodynamic Study of LiClO<sub>4<\/sub> Activity Coefficients in Aqueous Solution at (288.15, 298.15, and 308.18) K","abstract":"The use of various electrolyte materials in a lithium ion battery must be studied under stable electrochemical conditions; therefore, the LiClO4 activity coefficients in water at the temperatures described in this work are the result of an electrochemical cell (ISE): Na-ISE|LiClO4(m)|ClO4-ISE.

In this work, softwood lignin was chemically modified with fatty acids to employ UV-triggered oxidative reactions occurring at long alk(en)yl chains as a pretreatment prior to thermostabilization. The chemical transformation of oleic acid-functionalized lignin (OAFL) under the UV irradiation was the free radical-based cross-linking reaction assisted by atmospheric oxygen, which successfully formed oxidatively cross-linked networks of lignin derivatives at the surface of the fiber. We observed that OAFL showed more rapid oxidative cross-linking than stearic acid-functionalized lignin (SAFL) because the presence of carbon\u2013carbon double bond in OAFL contributed to the formation of more stable allyl radicals in addition to alkyl radicals under the UV irradiation. This UV pretreatment played a pivotal role in the conversion of flexible pristine OAFL fibers into infusible fibers during the subsequent thermostabilization step at the elevation rate of 2 \u00b0C\/min without melt deformation. As the elevation rate of 2 \u00b0C\/min is among the fastest thermostabilization process for lignin-derived carbon fibers, the duration of the thermostabilization of the OAFL-derived fibers in this study (\u223c2 h) is considerably less than previously reported ones. In addition, the UV irradiation process in this study requires less power (150 W) and exposure time (8 min), which can be appreciated by carbon fiber manufacturers aiming to reduce the fabrication cost. Therefore, the chemical functionalization with fatty acids envisages the possibility to produce carbon fibers from lignin precursors via a rapid stabilization step with spending less amount of time and energy."},{"title":"Electrochemical Tuning of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance in Copper Chalcogenide Nanocrystals","abstract":"In this work, we developed a method to study in situ the optical properties of Cu2\u2013xSe and CuS nanocrystals upon electrochemical reduction and oxidation. Both these materials possess a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the near-infrared region. First, the nanoparticles were embedded into a transparent film made of a perfluorinated sulfonic-acid copolymer Nafion deposited onto an ITO-coated glass. This substrate was employed as a working electrode for chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry measurements directly in a transparent cell allowing for simultaneous acquisition of absorption spectra of the system upon its charging\/discharging. We observed that LSPR of the Cu2\u2013xSe NCs can be well-controlled and tuned in a wide range simply by potentiostatic potential switching. Starting with an intensive plasmon of the initial as-synthesized Cu2\u2013xSe NCs we were able to completely damp it via reduction (electron injection). Moreover, this electrochemical tuning was demonstrated to be reversible by subsequent oxidation (extracting electrons from the system). At the same time, CuS NCs did not exhibit such prominent LSPR modulation upon the same experimental conditions due to their more metallic-like electronic structure. Hence, our findings demonstrate for the first time a reversible tuning of the LSPR of copper chalcogenide NCs without any chemical or structural modification. Such a wide LSPR tunability is of paramount importance, for example in applications of these materials in photovoltaics to amplify light absorption, in systems involving plasmon\u2013exciton interactions to controllably quench\/enhance light emission, and in electrochromic devices to control their transmittance."},{"title":"Polymethacrylates with Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS) Moieties: Influence of Spacer Length on Packing, Thermodynamics, and Dynamics","abstract":"Polymethacrylates with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) moieties (poly(POSS-MA)s) with flexible spacers between the POSS cages and the methacrylate group have distinctly different properties from their linear counterpart, i.e., PMMA.

As a result, the freezing of the backbone dynamics is shifted to lower temperatures, and the nanocomposites appear softer than linear PMMA chains of similar degrees of polymerization.

The initial charge heterogeneity of the unconjugated IgG-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was assessed by separating intact charge variants. Three main charge variants were resolved in the CE dimension. These variants were attributed to pyroglutamic acid formation and decarboxylation on the primary structure of the mAb through characteristic mass shifts and changes in electrophoretic mobility. Additionally, glycoforms of the antibody charge variants were identified in the deconvoluted mass spectra. The observed glycoforms and their distribution compared favorably to a released N-glycan analysis performed on the mAb. After conjugation, the ADC was analyzed using the same microchip CE\u2013MS method. The addition of a drug load resulted in a decrease in mobility and an increase in mass of 3145 Da. Five main species that differed in their respective drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) were fully resolved in the CE separation, with each DAR displaying the same variant population observed on the unconjugated mAb. A DAR range of 0\u20134 was observed with an average of 1.7 drug loads.

In this study, using virtual screening, we found that corilagin, a natural compound, was screened as a potential Stp1 inhibitor. Then, the phosphatase assay exhibited high inhibitory activity against Stp1. On the basis of the enzyme kinetics experiment, we found that corilagin exhibited a dual inhibitory mechanism of competitive and allosteric inhibition. To further elucidate the mechanism of interaction between corilagin and Stp1, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the Stp1\u2013corilagin complex. Consistent with the mutagenesis assays and fluorescence quenching assays results, the competitive and allosteric binding sites of corilagin with Stp1 were identified. In the competitive binding site of Stp1, Asn162, Ile164, Tyr199, and Lys232 were found to play a key role in this complex. In the allosteric binding site, hydrophobic interaction was the main binding force. The Asn142, Val145, Leu146, Pro152, and Phe179 residues of Stp1 were found to play a critical role in the binding of corilagin with Stp1.

We show that the steady-state voltammetric response of a microelectrode used in a closed bipolar cell can be quantitatively understood by considering the responses of both poles in their respective conventional two-electrode setups. In comparison to a conventional electrochemical cell, the voltammetric response of the bipolar cell has a similar sigmoidal shape and limiting current; however, the response is often slower than that of the typical two-electrode setup. This leads to a broader voltammogram and a decreased wave slope, which can be somewhat misleading, causing the appearance that the process being studied is irreversible when it instead can be a result of the coupling of two reversible processes. We show that a large limiting current on the excess pole would facilitate the observation of a faster voltammetric response and that both redox concentration and electrode area of the excess pole affect the wave shape. Both factors should be maximized in electroanalytical experiments in order to obtain fast voltammetric responses on the main electrode of interest and to detect quick changes in analyte concentrations."},{"title":"Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Synthesis of AlFe-PILC-Supported MnCe Catalysts for Benzene Combustion","abstract":"An efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of AlFe-pillared clay (AlFe-PILC)-supported MnCe catalysts was explored.

The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy\u2013energy dispersive spectrometry and were tested for the catalytic combustion of benzene and temperature-programmed surface reaction using a microreactor. Compared to conventional methods, this method is simpler and less costly and results in a larger specific surface area, pore volume, and basal spacing, with the ability to control the structure of the catalytic materials. MnCe(6:1)\/AlFe-PILC has the highest catalytic activity and can completely degrade benzene (600 ppm in air) at 250 \u00b0C. The activity of the catalyst is stable, and no obvious deactivation is observed at 230 \u00b0C after 1000 continuous hours. The catalyst is resistant to water and Cl-poisoning. The amount of CeO2 added is critical to the dispersion of MnOx on the support and the creation of optimum number of oxygen vacancy defect sites for the benzene oxidation reaction.

The ammonia response of the OFET was reversible and was not affected by changes in relative humidity from 45 to 100%.

(2005) FEBS J. 272, 2557\u22122565) that the chemical modification of Cys 85 residue of S100A1 protein by disulfide bond formation with small thiols such as glutathione, cysteine, or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2ME) leads to a dramatic increase of the protein affinity for calcium. Therefore, the biological function of S100A1 as a calcium signal transmitter is probably regulated by the redox potential within the cell. Systematic, structural studies of various mixed disulfides of S100A1 in the apo and holo states are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon. Using NMR methods we have determined the structure of apo-S100A1-\u03b2ME and, on the basis of 15N nuclear magnetic relaxation data, we have characterized the structural dynamics of both:\u2009 modified and unmodified molecules of apo-S100A1. The following effects of \u03b2ME modification have been observed:\u2009 (1) Helices IV and IV\u2018 of two protein subunits are elongated by five residues (85\u221289). (2) Conformation of the calcium binding N-terminal loops is dramatically changed, and structural flexibility of the N-loops as well as C-loops markedly increases.

All these observations lead to the conclusion that \u03b2ME modification of apo-S100A1 makes its structure more similar to that of holo-S100A1, so that it becomes much better adjusted for calcium coordination.

We show by circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopic, and X-ray crystallographic analyses of a newly purified group I CTX A6 from eastern Taiwan cobra (Naja atra) venoms that its loop I conformation adopts a type VIa turn with a cis peptide bond located between two proline residues of PPxY. A similar \u201cbanana-twisted\u201d conformation can be observed in other group I CTXs and also in cyclolinopeptide A and its analogues. By binding to the membrane environment, group I CTX undergoes a conformational change to adopt a more extended hydrophobic domain with \u03b2-sheet twisting closer to the one adopted by group II CTX. This result resolves a discrepancy in the CTX structural difference reported previously between solution as well as crystal state and shows that, in addition to the hydrophobicity, the exact loop I conformation also plays an important role in CTX\u2212membrane interaction. Potential protein targets of group I CTXs after cell internalization are also discussed on the basis of the determined loop I conformation. "},{"title":"Probing the Interior of Peptide Amphiphile Supramolecular Aggregates","abstract":"We present a study of the aqueous solvation within self-assembled structures formed from peptide amphiphiles. We have placed tryptophan and pyrene chromophores onto the peptide backbone to enable spectroscopic examinations of the interior of the resulting supramolecular objects. Self-assembly constrains the chromophores to a defined location within an aggregate, and they experience differing degrees of quencher penetration reflective of their depth within the nanostructure. Tryptophan fluorescence indicates that the interiors remain well-solvated, suggesting that the supramolecular aggregates maintain high degrees of free volume. The Stern\u2212Volmer quenching constants and the fractional accessibility (of covalently bound pyrene) progressively increase as the chromophore is placed closer to the aggregate exterior. Furthermore, these aggregates encourage chromophore uptake from aqueous solution as evidenced by the solubilization of free pyrene chromophores. Our findings demonstrate that covalently bound fluorophores within an aggregate can interact with the external environment. Studies with small molecular probes indicate that these self-assembled architectures may represent viable vehicles to sequester hydrophobic, insoluble organic molecules (within the interior) and to present signaling protein epitopes to cells (on the periphery).

Intrinsically disordered proteins lack secondary and\/or tertiary structure in their native state. Thus, characterizing the local structure and dynamics of hydration water around disordered proteins is challenging for both experimentalists and theoreticians. The local structure, orientation and dynamics of hydration water in the vicinity of intrinsically disordered proteins is investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis of the hydration capacity reveals that the disordered proteins have much larger binding capacity for hydration water than globular proteins. The surface and radial distribution of water molecules around the disordered proteins depict a similar trend. The local structure of the hydration water evaluated in terms of the tetrahedral order parameter, shows a higher order among the water molecules surrounding disordered proteins\/regions. The residence time of water molecules clearly exhibits slow dynamics of hydration water around the surface of disordered proteins\/regions as compared to globular proteins. The orientation of water molecules is found to be distinctly different for ordered and disordered proteins\/regions. This analysis provides a better insight into the structure and dynamics of hydration water around disordered proteins."},{"title":"The Structure of the Periplasmic Sensor Domain of the Histidine Kinase CusS Shows Unusual Metal Ion Coordination at the Dimeric Interface","abstract":"In bacteria, two-component systems act as signaling systems to respond to environmental stimuli. Two-component systems generally consist of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator, which work together through histidyl-aspartyl phosphorelay to result in gene regulation. One of the two-component systems in Escherichia coli, CusS\u2013CusR, is known to induce expression of cusCFBA genes at increased periplasmic Cu(I) and Ag(I) concentrations to help maintain metal ion homeostasis. CusS is a membrane-associated histidine kinase with a periplasmic sensor domain connected to the cytoplasmic ATP binding and catalytic domains through two transmembrane helices. The mechanism of how CusS senses increasing metal ion concentrations and activates CusR is not yet known. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Ag(I)-bound periplasmic sensor domain of CusS at a resolution of 2.15 \u00c5. The structure reveals that CusS forms a homodimer with four Ag(I) binding sites per dimeric complex. Two symmetric metal binding sites are found at the dimeric interface, which are each formed by two histidines and one phenylalanine with an unusual cation\u2212\u03c0 interaction. The other metal ion binding sites are in a nonconserved region within each monomer. Functional analyses of CusS variants with mutations in the metal sites suggest that the metal ion binding site at the dimer interface is more important for function. The structural and functional data provide support for a model in which metal-induced dimerization results in increases in kinase activity in the cytoplasmic domains of CusS."},{"title":"<i>C<\/i><sub>2<\/sub>-Symmetric Planar Chiral Ferrocene Diamides by (\u2212)-Sparteine-Mediated Directed <i>ortho<\/i>-Lithiation.

As the dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions proceed on acidic and basic oxide catalyst surfaces, respectively, the aspect observed on the same single crystal surface seems to be not compatible with the conventional acid\u2212base catalysis concept. To clarify the origin of the switchover of the acid\u2212base catalysis, the reaction mechanism of the HCOOH dehydrogenation was studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was concluded from the DFT calculations together with the rate equation and experimentally determined activation energy that the bimolecular dehydrogenation proceeds between a strongly adsorbed bridging formate anion and a weakly adsorbed HCOOH molecule by cooperative catalysis of three adjacent surface Ti4+ ions as Lewis acidic sites on the surface. This mechanism is entirely different from the previous dehydration mechanism that the dehydration occurs on an oxygen point defect (basic character) formed in situ by H2O desorption from two OH under the catalytic dehydration reaction conditions. Thus, the TiO2(110) surface provides two kinds of active sites for the HCOOH decomposition in a manner different from the traditional acid\u2212base catalysis concept.

A kinetic modeling was performed on the basis of a power-law rate equation using a proposed simplified molecular reaction scheme. The reaction scheme consists of three reaction pathways:\u2009 (1) p-xylene to p-tolualdehyde (PTAL), (2) p-xylene to TPAL, and (3) p-xylene to COx (CO and CO2). Model parameters were estimated from the experimental data through minimization of the objective function. The activation energy for the formation of TPAL from p-xylene was 49.2 kJ\/mol. The order of reaction was approximated to zero with respect to partial pressure of p-xylene. The kinetic model yields an excellent fit of the experimental data.

The rate of reduction of the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor has a large kinetic isotope effect (KIE = 16.8 \u00b1 0.5), and the KIE is independent of temperature. Analysis of the temperature dependence of C\u2212H bond breakage revealed that extreme (ground state) quantum tunneling is responsible for the transfer of the hydrogen nucleus. Reaction rates are strongly dependent on temperature, indicating thermally induced, vibrational motion drives the H-transfer reaction. The data provide direct experimental evidence for enzymatic bond breakage by extreme tunneling driven by vibrational motion of the protein scaffold. The results demonstrate that classical transition state theory and its tunneling derivatives do not adequately describe this enzymatic reaction.

Here, we systematically investigate energy transfer interactions between C60 fullerenes and four different QDs, composed of CdSe\/ZnS (type I) and CdSe\/CdS\/ZnS (quasi type II), with emission maxima ranging from 530 to 630 nm. C60-pyrrolidine tris-acid was first coupled to the N-terminus of a hexahistidine-terminated peptide via carbodiimide chemistry to yield a C60-labeled peptide (pepC60). This peptide provided the critical means to achieve ratiometric self-assembly of the QD-(pepC60) nanoheterostructures by exploiting metal affinity coordination to the QD surface. Controlled QD-(pepC60)N bioconjugates were prepared by discretely increasing the ratio (N) of pepC60 assembled per QD in mixtures of dimethyl sulfoxide and buffer; this mixed organic\/aqueous approach helped alleviate issues of C60 solubility. An extensive set of control experiments were initially performed to verify the specific and ratiometric nature of QD-(pepC60)N assembly. Photoinitiated energy transfer in these hybrid organic\u2013inorganic systems was then interrogated using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence along with ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Coordination of pepC60 to the QD results in QD PL quenching that directly tracks with the number of peptides displayed around the QD. A detailed photophysical analysis suggests a competition between electron transfer and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer from the QD to the C60 that is dependent upon a complex interplay of pepC60 ratio per QD, the presence of underlying spectral overlap, and contributions from QD size. These results highlight several important factors that must be considered when designing QD-donor\/C60-acceptor systems for potential optoelectronic and biosensing applications."},{"title":"Discovery of Small Molecule Inhibitors of Protein\u2212Protein Interactions Using Combined Ligand and Target Score Normalization","abstract":"Docking experiments of multiple compounds typically focus on a single protein.

The combined docking score was normalized by drug and protein and by incorporating information on contact similarity to the template protein\u2212peptide contacts. The 20 top ranking hits included 6 true positives, and three matches with suggestive evidence in the literature: the cardiac glycoside digitoxin may inhibit WW domain interactions, the 14-3-3 \u03b6 protein may bind negatively charged ligands, and the nuclear receptor coactivator site may bind nuclear receptor agonists. Additionally, the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein is predicted to bind pargyline, and the antiapoptic p53 interacting protein MDM2 is suggested to bind clofazimine.

In contrast with the results generally reported in literature, it is shown that, for both silicate and germanate waveguides, the Ag site is strongly dependent on the Ag content and the Ag\u2212O distance is longer for higher doping levels. It is demonstrated that this trend is related to a structural rearrangement of the Ag site in the whole doped layer; the EXAFS results on the samples that underwent the ion exchange at higher temperatures and the comparison with literature data suggest that the sites with shorter distances are more stable. The correlation between local structure around Ag and the photoluminescence properties of the borosilicate waveguides is established. In particular, the red shift of the blue band observed in the absorption and excitation spectra by increasing the Ag concentration has been univocally related to the increase of the Ag\u2212O bond length."},{"title":"H-Bonded Effects on Novel Supramolecular Dendrimers Containing Electron-Transporting Donor Dendrons and Single\/Double H-Bonded Acceptor Emitters","abstract":"Novel asymmetric\/symmetric supramolecular dendrimers were constructed by two kinds of (single\/double) H-bonded acceptor chromophores, i.e., pyridyl\/bispyridyl acceptor emitters, encapsulated with (one or two) 1,3,4-oxadiazole (OXD) donor dendrons in proper acceptor\/donor molar ratios. These acceptor emitters were also complexed with another type of dendritic donor cores to form exterior emitting shells reverse to the previous system (with emitting cores) via self-assembly of complementary H-bonded moieties. Because of the shielding effect of bulky OXD dendritic shells in H-bonded donors, the supramolecular dendrimers are able to prevent acceptor emitters from spatial aggregation, and thus to induce glass-forming properties (with Tg) and show stronger emission intensities via H-bonds. Besides, the dendritic donors act as efficient light-harvesting antennae capable of transferring light energy from their peripheral OXD arms to their emitting acceptors, where the chromophore luminance induced by energy transfer is more efficient than that by direct excitation of the emitting cores. Compared with analogous dendritic mixtures without H-bonds, higher quantum yields were observed in the supramolecular dendrimers because of better energy transfer from OXD units. Therefore, compared with acceptor emitters, not only can the emission wavelength be tuned (up to 100 nm of red-shift) by H-bonds, but also much higher emission efficiencies of the H-bonded complexes were induced by reduced aggregation and energy transfer from the OXD donor dendrons.

This analogue was prepared by nonenzymatic synthesis of a racemic phosphopantetheine analogue followed by enzymatic conversion to the corresponding CoA analogue. Stereochemical analysis showed that the natural enantiomer of the phosphopantetheine analogue was selectively converted to product by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyltansferase, yielding a product that possessed the desired stereoconfiguration. Reaction of the new synthon 1c with a primary amine results in amide bond formation to form the CoA analogue of interest. This new methodology provides access to an even broader array of CoA analogues modified in the \u03b2-alanylcysteamine moiety. This has been demonstrated in the synthesis of an analogue having an extra methylene group in the \u03b2-alanine moiety and two analogues in which the amide bond nearest the thiol group is replaced with a pair of methylene groups.

PDA-coated polystyrene (PS) microspheres are synthesized by polymerization of dopamine on sulfonated PS microspheres and then assembled using positively charged chitosan (CHI) layers as link agents. After the PS core templates were removed, microporous architectures composed of PDA microcapsules were obtained. The produced microporous PDA architectures have a high capability of adsorbing BMP-2 and realize the sustained release of BMP-2. More importantly, the bioadhesive micro architecture and its immobilized BMP-2 synergistically enhance the activity and osteogenetic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Both supercell adhesion and BMP-2 immobilization ability of these architectures are attributed to the intrinsic adhesive nature of PDA and the porous architectures via the assembly of PDA microcapsules. The bioadhesive microporous PDA architectures with both cell affinitive and GF release features have a great potential to mimic natural ECM for modifying various medical devices in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."},{"title":"One-Electron Oxidation of DNA by Ionizing Radiation: Competition between Base-to-Base Hole-Transfer and Hole-Trapping","abstract":"The distance of hole migration through DNA determines the degree to which radiation-induced lesions are clustered. It is the degree of clustering that confers to ionizing radiation its high toxicity. The migration distance is governed by a competition between hole transfer and irreversible trapping reactions. An important type of trapping is reactions that lead to the formation of deoxyribose radicals, which are precursors to free base release (fbr). Using HPLC, fbr was measured in X-irradiated films of d(CGCGCGCGCG)2 and d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 as well as three genomic DNAs: M. luteus, calf thymus, and C. perfringens. The level of DNA hydration was varied from \u0393 = 2.5 to 22 mol waters\/mol nucleotide. The chemical yields of each base, G(base), were measured and used to calculate the modification factor, M(base). This factor compensates for differences in the GC\/AT ratio, providing a measure of the degree to which a given base influences its own release. In the DNA oligomers, M(Gua) &gt; M(Cyt), a result ascribed to the previously observed end effect in short oligomers. In the highly polymerized genomic DNA, we found that M(Cyt) &gt; M(Gua) and that M(Thy) is consistently the smallest of the M factors. For these same DNA films, the yields of total DNA trapped radicals, Gtot(fr), were measured using EPR spectroscopy. The yield of deoxyribose radicals was calculated using GdRib(fr) = \u223c0.11 \u00d7 Gtot(fr). Comparing GdRib(fr) with total fbr, we found that only about half of the fbr is accounted for by deoxyribose radical intermediates. We conclude that for a hole on cytosine, Cyt\u2022+, base-to-base hole transfer competes with irreversible trapping by the deoxyribose. In the case of a hole on thymine, Thy\u2022+, base-to-base hole transfer competes with irreversible trapping by methyl deprotonation.

(2) Phase transfer:\u2009 \u03b1-TOH can transport radical character into the lipoprotein. Given the limitations of existing initiators, there is a need for new compounds that avoid the requirement for \u03b1-TOH to act as a phase-transfer agent. We report here a study showing that the new unsymmetrical azo compound, C-8, initiates LDL lipid peroxidation without requirement for \u03b1-TOH. This initiator provides a steady source of free amphiphilic peroxyl radicals that efficiently initiates oxidation of \u03b1-TOH-depleted LDL at a rate comparable to that reported for the very reactive hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH). With other initiators tested, unsymmetrical C-12 and C-16 and symmetrical C-0 and MeOAMVN, \u03b1-TOH-depleted LDL displayed significant resistance to oxidation. Results indicate that the amphiphilic nature of the unsymmetrical initiators increases their partitioning into lipoprotein depending on the hydrocarbon chain length, and the symmetrical azo initiators C-0 and MeOAMVN primarily remain in the aqueous phase. Evidence suggests that even when the phase-transfer activity of \u03b1-TOH is limited, with the use of an initiator such as C-8, the mechanism of peroxidation remains controlled by TMP chain-transfer activity.

When the system had sufficient ligand protection for the nanocrystals, nanodots were found to be the stable products. The diameters of nearly monodisperse nanodots and nanoflowers were varied in a range from \u223c5 to \u223c15 nm and \u223c15 to \u223c60 nm, respectively.

Both nearly monodispersed nanodots and nanoflowers can be made through either of the reaction pathways. Hydrolysis was found as a reversible pathway, and alcoholysis was confirmed to be irreversible.

In this paper, two long-range corrected functionals, CAM-B3LYP and \u03c9B97X, are applied together with the traditional B3LYP functional in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations to systematically investigate thelow-lying electronic excitations in both oligomers. Our calculations indicate that an extensive conjugation exists between monomer molecular orbitals in 2,7-linked oligomers, which is absent in those of 3,6-linked structures, resulting in a considerable narrowing of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of their backbone moiety, while having little effect on the side chains. CAM-B3LYP and \u03c9B97x calculations confirm that the lowest-energy absorption is a within-backbone excitation in longer 2,7-linked oligomers as opposed to a backbone to side-chain charge transfer excitation in 2,7-linked oligmers of shorter length and 3,6-linked oligomers of any length.

The backbone atomic root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values of both domains were 0.7 \u00c5 when calculated separately, which is smaller than that of the molecule as a whole (1.4 \u00c5). Measurement of 15N-{1H} NOE values show that the residues in the corner of the L-shaped molecule are undergoing fast internal motion. These results indicate that the joint region between two domains contributes to the fluctuation in the orientation of two domains. Thus, it was shown that RRF remains the tRNA mimicry in solution where it functions.

HTSNCR), in a 50 MWe tangentially firing boiler of pulverized coal. Over the last several years, the characteristics of HTSNCR were investigated in the bench-scale experiments, as presenting the temperature window of SNCR can extend to a higher temperature range in the absence of oxygen. Therefore, HTSNCR provides a promising option of greater NOx reduction via injecting urea solution or ammonia into the primary combustion zone specialized with oxygen of nearly zero in furnace. These retrofit experiments in this paper successfully showed the ability of HTSNCR. NOx emission of 68 mg\/Nm3 was finally achieved through use of the optimum hybrid application of HTSNCR, SNCR, and OFA. The overall reduction efficiency is approximately 90%, in which 17% is devoted by HTSNCR. The main factors in HTSNCR were studied extensively, including (1) primary stoichiometric ratio (SR1) of air staging, (2) normalized stoichiometric ratio (NSR) of reagent quantity injected, (3) allocation of injectors, e.g., on the corners or at the middle of side walls, (4) ammonia slip brought about by HTSNCR or SNCR, (5) optimized hybrid configuration about SNCR and HTSNCR. On the basis of the optimum setting of the above factors, two key features of HTSNCR employed in a tangentially firing furnace were obtained. First, there is a critical minimum value of NOx emission in the relationship of NOx emission versus NSR1 of HTSNCR. More NSR1 beyond the critical value, i.e., more reagent quantity injected, results in more NOx formation. Secondarily, the injection of reagent near the corners is beneficial to reach higher NOx reduction rather than that injected from the side walls, due to the aerodynamics in the tangentially firing furnace."},{"title":"Structure\u2013Property Relationships of Oligonucleotide Polyelectrolyte Complex Micelles","abstract":"Polyelectrolyte complex micelles (PCMs), nanoparticles formed by electrostatic self-assembly of charged polymers with charged-neutral hydrophilic block copolymers, offer a potential solution to the challenging problem of delivering therapeutic nucleic acids into cells and organisms. Promising results have been reported in vitro and in animal models but basic structure\u2013property relationships are largely lacking, and some reports have suggested that double-stranded nucleic acids cannot form PCMs due to their high bending rigidity. This letter reports a study of PCMs formed by DNA oligonucleotides of varied length and hybridization state and poly(l)lysine-poly(ethylene glycol) block copolymers with varying block lengths. We employ a multimodal characterization strategy combining small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), multiangle light scattering (MALS), and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to simultaneously probe the morphology and internal structure of the micelles. Over a wide range of parameters, we find that nanoparticle shape is controlled primarily by the hybridization state of the oligonucleotides with single-stranded oligonucleotides forming spheroidal micelles and double-stranded oligonucleotides forming wormlike micelles. The length of the charged block controls the radius of the nanoparticle, while oligonucleotide length appears to have little impact on either size or shape. At smaller length scales, we observe parallel packing of DNA helices inside the double-stranded nanoparticles, consistent with results from condensed genomic DNA. We also describe salt- and thermal-annealing protocols for preparing PCMs with high repeatability and low polydispersity. Together, these results provide a capability to rationally design PCMs with desired sizes and shapes that should greatly assist development of this promising delivery technology."},{"title":"New Six-Membered pH-Insensitive Rhodamine Spirocycle in Selective Sensing of Cu<sup>2+<\/sup> through C\u2013C Bond Cleavage and Its Application in Cell Imaging","abstract":"A new rhodamine-based chemosensor 1 with a six-membered spirocyclic ring has been synthesized, which exhibits excellent pH stability and shows selective \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescent detection of Cu2+ ions over a series of other metal ions including Cu+ ions.

This photoredox reaction resulted in the generation of tetrathiocyanatocorroles in good yields. The synthesis of tetrathiocyanatocorroles was never reported earlier. Single-crystal XRD analysis reveals that the insertion of four thiocyanate moieties at the four \u03b2-pyrrolic positions has imparted significant distortion to the corrole macrocycle. The generated tetrathiocyanatocorroles are different from the parent corroles in many ways. The photophysical properties of the newly synthesized tetrathiocyanatocorroles are dramatically altered from the parent corroles. The absorption feature of these modified corrole derivatives (both position and intensity) bears a nice similarity with the chlorophyll-a macrocycle. Thus, these newly synthesized molecules can be considered as spectroscopic model systems for chlorophyll-a pigments. The observed absorption and emission spectra of these tetrathiocyanatocorroles certainly point out that these newly developed ligand scaffolds and their various metal complexes will have immense potential as pigments in solar cells and also as NIR-emissive dyes. The observed C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Au weak interactions in a representative Au(III)-corrole complex point out that these complexes are capable of activating the unfunctionalized C\u2013H groups and thus will have potential implications in C-H activation reactions."},{"title":"Assignment of Absolute Stereochemistry and Total Synthesis of (\u2212)-Spongidepsin","abstract":"An enantioselective total synthesis of (\u2212)-spongidepsin (2) and elucidation of the absolute stereochemistry of its four stereocenters are described.

Our method for multienzyme complexes (MECs) assembled on Yarrowia lipolytica yeast cells is based on simultaneous surface display of a synthetic multiple cohesins backbone (scaffoldin) and extracellular secretion of dockerin-fusions of individual enzymes. This methodology was applied to fatty acid-derived hydrocarbon (alkenes, alkanes) production. The genetically tailored cell-associated MECs exhibited different proportional and positional effects through genetically encoded customization of the scaffoldin arrangement by varying the copy number and orientation of cohesin domains. The genetically encoded specific positional arrangement of individual enzymes was able to endow MECs with an obvious substrate channeling effect, reflected by a more than 17-fold enhancement in the initial reaction rate. Optimization of the co-immobilized multienzyme complex (through proportional and positional control of cohesin domains) gave much higher conversion yields (71\u201384%) compared to a free enzymes cocktail (8\u201332%). The resulting engineered yeast strains, designed for the one-pot fermentation process, integrate surface display of scaffoldin, extracellular production of dockerin-fused individual enzyme components, and highly efficient reassembly of the functional elements through a genetically programmable process. Interestingly, the growing cells of MEC system provides a unique promotion effect to drive the substrate flux toward the final product, through consuming the byproduct (glycerol) as a carbon source during cascade reactions. This adopted technology provides an efficient platform for creating tailored multienzymes for advanced cascade biosynthesis."},{"title":"Diphenylpyridylethanamine (DPPE) Derivatives as Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) Inhibitors","abstract":"A series of diphenylpyridylethanamine (DPPE) derivatives was identified exhibiting potent CETP inhibition.

This investigation, based on a structural classification of molybdenum phosphates, derived from that proposed by Costentin et al., allows a detailed discussion of both the valence of the different Mo sites as well as the different coupling mechanisms for the unpaired electron of the Mo(V) octahedra. Either direct Mo\u2212Mo or indirect interaction through the shared oxygen atoms can lead to magnetic moments per Mo(V) lower than expected.

The fluorescence quantum yield with ATP was significantly enhanced, from almost zero to 0.61, resulting in remarkable enhancement of sensitivity. This was attributed to the increase of radiative decay rate of NIR dye by 30-fold, along with almost unchanged nonradiative decay rate. The limit of detection for ATP was 0.6 nM, and it was successfully applied to determine low ATP levels (10.1 \u00b1 2.6 nM) in rat brain.

The single-phase and single-crystal nanorod arrays of MoO3 grown in random directions from a silica glass substrate had mean diameters and lengths of 10 and 500 nm, respectively, as determined through chemical analysis. The citric acid plays a critical role for the nanorods growth process from investigating the relative molar ratio of molybdate and citric acid in the precursor. Moreover, the dissociation timing of the citric acid, which was controlled by the other two synthesis parameters, i.e., sintering time and solvents, also greatly influences growth and phase transition of the MoO3 nanorods, which was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthesis parameters were optimized to design the length and density of the nanorod arrays. The longest nanorods can be obtained up to 600 nm using a dimethylacetamide solvent, a molar ratio of Mo:citric acid = 0.5:1.5, and sintering at 673 K for 15 min in an ambient atmosphere. Findings of the present study describe that the factors of the nanorods\u2019 growth and phase changing are deeply correlated with disassemble steps of the Mo metal\u2013citric acid complex in the sol\u2013gel precursor solution, which may contribute to applying the material development in several electronic devices using MoO3 nanostructures."},{"title":"One-Step Synthesis of SnI<sub>2<\/sub>\u00b7(DMSO)<sub><i>x<\/i><\/sub> Adducts for High-Performance Tin Perovskite Solar Cells","abstract":"Contemporary thin-film photovoltaic (PV) materials contain elements that are scarce (CIGS) or regulated (CdTe and lead-based perovskites), a fact that may limit the widespread impact of these emerging PV technologies.

Nanoscale thermal hotspot images are obtained by a photothermal scanning probe microscopy technique with laser illumination wavelength tuned at the different plasmonic resonances of the arrays. Spectral analysis indicates that both Joule heating by the metal antennas and surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) by the polymer molecules located in the apical hotspots of the antennas are responsible for thermoplasmonic resonances, that is, for strong local temperature increase. At odds with more conventional planar nanoantennas, the vertical antenna structure enables thermal decoupling of the hotspot at the antenna apex from the heat sink constituted by the solid substrate. The temperature increase was evaluated by quantitative comparison of data obtained with the photothermal expansion technique to the results of electromagnetic\/thermal simulations. In the case of strong SEIRA by the C\u2550O bond of poly-methylmethacrylate at 1730 cm\u20131, for focused mid-infrared laser power of about 20 mW, the evaluated order of magnitude of the nanoscale temperature increase is of 10 K.

Because of their high reactivity toward \u03b5-amino groups of lysyl residues, isoLGs are found as protein adducts in vivo. Plasma levels of isoLG-derived protein modifications are orders of magnitude higher than levels of the corresponding isoprostane. This suggests that while isoprostanes are rapidly cleared from the circulation, isoLG\u2212protein adducts accumulate over the lifetime of the protein, which can be weeks, and this may provide a dosimeter for oxidant stress. We now confirm the postulated formation of the first D series isoLG, iso[7]LGD2, by free radical-induced oxidation of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in vitro. We also show that iso[7]LGD2\u2212protein adduct levels in blood are the highest known for an isoLG-derived epitope.

Similarly, iso[7]LGD2-derived epitope levels in oxidized low density lipoprotein are 20 times higher than isoLGE2\u2212protein and five times higher than iso[4]LGE2\u2212protein levels. Previous studies showed that plasma levels of protein-bound E series isoLGs, i.e., isoLGE2 and iso[4]LGE2, are elevated in individuals with atherosclerosis as compared with age-matched controls.

The half-widths \u039b of the dielectric loss curves for the primary processes of those systems are compared with those of the PVAc\/Tol system reported previously. The data indicate that \u039b decreases in order of PVAc\/Tol, PVAc\/MN, and PVOc\/Tol systems if compared at the same temperature T\/Tg where Tg denotes the glass transition temperature of solutions. The half-width of each solution increases with decreasing temperature. The loss curve is calculated by assuming a Gaussian distribution of the local concentration \u03c6 which results in the distribution of relaxation times g(\u03c4). The calculated loss curves agree fairly well with the observed ones. The broadening behavior is also explained by assuming that \u039b is proportional to the amplitude of the local concentration fluctuation \u0394\u03c6 times the slope of the \u03c6 dependence curve of the average relaxation time \u03c4. This assumption leads to a linear relationship between \u039b and \u0394\u03c6\/(T \u2212 T0)2 where T0 is the Vogel critical temperature. Using this relation, we have attempted to estimate \u0394\u03c6. Small-angle X-ray scattering was also measured on PVAc\/MN solutions and found that the scattering intensity was lower than that for PVAc\/Tol. This is consistent with the fact that \u039b of PVAc\/MN solutions is narrower than PVAc\/Tol solutions.

The analysis of Auger electrons evidenced that the lower (apparent) TOF of accessible Co0 sites in the absence of Ru and at Ru concentrations beyond 0.2 wt % is bridged to the development, under reaction conditions, of FTS-inactive cobalt carbide (CoCx) and cobalt oxide (CoOx) patches, respectively, at the outermost surface of cobalt crystallites."},{"title":"Direct Mass Spectrometric Monitoring of Solid Phase Organic Syntheses","abstract":"Direct on-bead monitoring of solid-phase reactions is possible with soft laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SLD-TOF MS) without prior cleavage from the resin if photocleavable phenacyl ester or o-nitroveratryl linker groups are employed.

In the early years since Apollo sample return, only bulk soil and bulk rock samples were analyzed for H2O as well as other volatiles. From 1970 to 2007, it was thought that the Moon is essentially devoid of innate H2O, containing probably less than 1 ppb. New technologies gradually enabled the measurements of H2O in lunar glass beads, soil glass, minerals such as apatite and anorthite, and olivine-hosted melt inclusions. The advancements in measurement techniques led to improved data and new insights. Starting from 2008, significant H2O in deep-sourced lunar rocks has been reported, resulting in a paradigm shift from a bone-dry Moon to a fairly wet Moon, although there is still debate about whether the bulk silicate Moon contains \u223c100 ppm of H2O (similar to that in the Earth\u2019s MORB mantle) or only a few ppm H2O. The advances on our knowledge of H2O in the Moon is accompanied by increased understanding of other volatiles in the Moon. Gradually, the degrees of depletion of various volatiles in the Moon relative to the Earth were inferred. Using assessed data from available lunar samples, mostly the melt inclusions, and also bulk rock analyses, it is found that the inferred degrees of depletion for volatile elements in the Moon relative to the Earth do not vary much and are independent of the condensation temperature. It is proposed that an early veneer delivered the volatiles to both the Earth and the Moon, but the Moon received proportionally less of the early veneer planetesimals. In addition to H2O in the interior of the Moon, significant surface H2O in the form of ice in lunar polar regions and structural OH in agglutinate glass in lunar regolith originating from solar wind implantation has also been gradually quantified."},{"title":"Independent and Synergistic Modulations of Viscoelasticity and Stiffness of Dynamically Cross-Linked Cell-Encapsulating ClickGels by Covalently Tethered Polymer Brushes","abstract":"We report independent and synergistic modulations of the stiffness and viscoelasticity of ClickGels, formed by a combination of the bio-orthogonal covalent and dynamic noncovalent cross-linking, by covalently incorporating nonionic, zwitterionic, or anionic polymer brushes. Tethering nonionic and zwitterionic brushes at the cost of noncovalent cross-linking increased stiffness and slowed stress relaxation, respectively, without altering the other properties. Meanwhile, tethering anionic brushes significantly increased ClickGel stiffness, while also slowing its stress relaxation. ClickGels with faster stress relaxation, not reduced stiffness, promoted short-term (24 h) viability and YAP\/TAZ nuclear localization of encapsulated bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs). In contrast, ClickGel stiffness, not viscoelasticity, inversely correlated to the short-term dehydrogenase activity of encapsulated BMSCs. This work highlights the role of the ionic state of polymer brushes in modulating the hydrogel elastic modulus and viscoelasticity and establishes the brush-modified ClickGel as a facile and reproducible tool for manipulating mechanical cues of the synthetic cellular niche."},{"title":"Proton Transfer Voltammetry at Electrodes Modified with Acid Thiol Monolayers","abstract":"By combining a description of the potential profile at electrodes coated with acid thiol monolayers with a quadratic relationship between activation energy and electrode potential, a rather simple expression for proton transfer voltammograms is derived. Our electrostatic analysis shows that proton transfer can only produce narrow voltammetric peaks when the immobilized acid groups lie close to the metal substrate. Quantitative fits of experimental voltammograms obtained with an Au(111) electrode modified with a 11-mercaptoundecanoic monolayer at pH 8.5 reveal that less than 1% of the carboxylic groups in the monolayer participate in the potential induced proton transfer process and that these groups lay close to the metal surface. A preliminary analysis of the kinetic parameters suggests that the interfacial electric field facilitates an intrinsically slow proton exchange between a proton donor and acceptor pair that are not in close contact with each other at the interface."},{"title":"Synthesis of \u03b2-Linked Diporphyrins and Their Homo- and Hetero-Bimetallic Complexes","abstract":"\u03b2-Meta- and -para-linked diporphyrins have been synthesized from two complementary routes using Suzuki cross-coupling and Adler condensation.

Here we consider acyclic graphs (trees) only, and in particular we consider trees without bridging vertices because no isospectral trees in which both graphs are without bridging vertices have been hitherto reported. However, we found the smallest such isospectral trees when n = 15. When the maximal valence is limited to four, so that graphs correspond to molecules of organic chemistry, the smallest isospectral (nonbridging) trees have n = 19 vertices. The smallest pair of isospectral binary trees were found among trees having n = 26 vertices. By combining contraction of trees to proper trees (i.e., trees without bridging vertices) and subsequent pruning of proper trees one can in many cases determine if two trees are isomorphic or not from comparison of their characteristic polynomials.

E.; Finke, R. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc.2005, 127, 8179), where in general, A is the starting metal (e.g., Ir, Rh, Pt, or other metal precursors), B is the growing nanocluster, and C is larger, agglomerated nanoclusters. The broader importance of that work is that the first two steps of the above mechanism, A \u2192 B, A + B \u2192 2B, bear on the important problem how to best model kinetically and thereby interpret \u201cS\u201d-shaped, sigmoidal nucleation plus growth particle-formation curves that are ubiquitous throughout nature (the curves that are fit by the above 4-step mechanism are unusual and different from normal S-shaped, sigmoidal curves, as is discussed in the paper). Given the importance of accounting for S-shaped, sigmoidal kinetic curves for growth processes in nature, a recent paper in this journal (Skrdla, P. J.; Robertson, R. T. Chem. Mater.2008, 20, 3) hypothesized that it is important to use what are known as dispersive kinetics treatments to examine S-shaped phase transformation kinetic data. That paper did so by re-examining a single data set digitized from a figure in the above 2005 Besson, et al., paper and examining fits to \u201cstretched exponential\u201d functions from dispersive kinetics. That study reached two primary conclusions, namely that (i) \u201cThis work (i.e., the 2008 Chemistry of Materials paper) demonstrates that it may be possible to utilize much simpler (i.e., containing empirical but fewer fit parameters) dispersive\/solid-state kinetic models to determine the kinetics of nanoparticle formation than the four-parameter, mechanistic equation described in the original work by Besson et al.\u201d; and that (ii) the kinetic curves fit by the 4-step mechanism have \u201croutinely appeared in the (prior) solid-state kinetics literature since the advent of the Johnson\u2212Mehl\u2212Avrami\u2212Erove\u2019ev (JMAE, or, more simply, \u201cAvrami\u201d) equations in the late 1930s\/early 1940s\u201d. The validity of these two main hypotheses\/claims are re-examined herein using both additional data sets and using Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) statistical treatment for comparing models with different numbers of parameters. In addition to those results, the 2008 Chemistry of Materials paper and the present study are of broader and fundamental interest regarding (a) the more general question of the philosophy of model building in science; (b) the application of dispersive kinetic\/semiempirical vs chemical-mechanism-based models; and (c) the most important question of the role of disproof in science regardless of which approach to model building in science one is using.

Therefore, the underlying substrates and surrounding materials always disturb the pristine properties of 2D materials. Herein, we describe how the pristine properties of suspended 2D materials can be precisely extracted from Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra with great signal enhancements by taking advantage of both air gap suspension and nanocavity enhancement effects. The modes of the Raman emission lines were enhanced to almost the same degree when the 2D materials were positioned over the nanocavity: the 2D\/G peaks of suspended single-layer graphene (SLG) and the E12g\/A1g peaks of MoS2 were significantly enhanced almost equally. Moreover, recording Raman and PL spectra at different positions of the suspended 2D materials was a very powerful tool for observing charge transfer between the pristine 2D materials and the surrounding materials. We also found that the residual holes of the suspended SLG could be neutralized by aluminum (Al) at certain positions. By employing the air cavity structure, we could readily locate the charge neutrality point of the suspended 2D materials. In addition, the PL intensity of MoS2 could be greatly enhanced when using the same nanocavity. The great enhancements in the PL signals from the suspended 2D materials allowed us to further investigate the spectral weights of both the A0 exciton and A\u2013 trion peaks when MoS2 was suspended or supported upon various metal films. This approach may open up new doors for techniques allowing precise characterization of abundant information from pristine and suspended 2D materials."},{"title":"Graphene\u2013Carbon Nanotube Aerogel with a Scroll-Interconnected-Sheet Structure as an Advanced Framework for a High-Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Electrode","abstract":"Carbon nanomaterials have received much attention due to their good electrochemical performance as electrode materials and as substrates for pseudocapacitive materials.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to decrease the levels of reactive dicarbonyl compounds in foods. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of quercetin, a major dietary flavonoid, and its major mono- and di-MGO adducts on the formation of dicarbonyl compounds, such as methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO), in a lysine\/glucose aqueous system, a model system to reflect the Maillard reaction in food process. Our result indicated that quercetin could efficiently inhibit the formation of MGO and GO in a time-dependent manner. Further mechanistic study was conducted by monitoring the formation of quercetin oxidation and conjugation products using LC-MS\/MS. Quercetin MGO adducts, quercetin quinones, and the quinones of quercetin MGO adducts were detected in the system, indicating quercetin plays a dual role in inhibiting the formation of MGO and GO by scavenging free radicals generated in the system and trapping of MGO and GO to form MGO adducts. In addition, we prepared the mono- and di-MGO quercetin adducts and investigated their antioxidant activity and trapping capacity of MGO and GO. Our results indicated that both mono- and di-MGO quercetin adducts could scavenge the DPPH radical in a dose-dependent manner with &gt;40% DPPH scavenged by the MGO adducts at 10 \u03bcM, and the di-MGO quercetin adduct could further trap MGO to generate tri-MGO adducts. Therefore, we demonstrate for the first time that quercetin MGO adducts retain the antioxidant activity and trapping capacity of reactive dicarbonyl species."},{"title":"Electronic Structure and Orientation of Poly(<i>p<\/i>-phenylenevinylene) Monolayers on MoS<sub>2<\/sub> and Highly Oriented Pyrolitic Graphite","abstract":"We report investigations of monolayer films of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) adsorbed on both MoS2 and highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) surfaces. The monolayer was prepared by deposition of a precursor polymer using the Langmuir\u2212Blodgett technique and subsequent conversion to PPV by thermal treatment in ultrahigh vacuum. Photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were used to characterize the conversion and to determine the orientation of the PPV with respect to the substrate surfaces. The appearance of new features in both the X-ray absorption and the valence level photoemission spectra upon conversion can be interpreted in terms of the creation of \u03c0 conjugation along the polymer backbone. Additionally, in the angle-resolved photoemission measurements of the fully converted sample on HOPG, a weak dispersion of the \u03c0-derived features is just discernible. The angular dependence of the X-ray absorption spectra shows that the PPV monolayer on MoS2 is highly oriented, with its phenylene and vinylene moieties lying preferentially parallel to the surface.

Submicronic silica particles are first synthesized via a sol\u2212gel process and then functionalized with an appropriate coupling agent. After compression at the surface of a Langmuir trough to form a well-organized two-dimensional array, silica particles are transferred onto solid substrates.

Both d- and l-ketohexoses can be transformed into rare 3-deoxy-l-ketohexoses in six steps through a group transfer process. The key step involves a radical cyclized onto a carbonyl group, followed by a fragmentation reaction, eventually resulting in the group transfer of an \u03b1-oxy carbonyl group. The process involves tin-free and environmentally benign radical conditions (TTMSS\/AIBN\/toluene). The acyclic form of 3-deoxy-l-fructose was prepared in only three steps from the inexpensive starting material, d-fructose. A further modification by preparing a dithioacetal derivative was accomplished, which could serve as a convenient sugar synthon for further synthetic applications. Removal of the dithioacetal protecting group results in the formation of the rare 3-deoxy-l-fructose in a total yield of 42%.

Understanding the mechanism of CHF is the key to enhance heat transfer through boiling. In general, the classical theories account some aspects of surface, liquid, and interfacial properties and boiling phenomena. In this study, the experimental observations on pool boiling heat transfer are compared with the standard theoretical models. The porous nanotube surface enabled capillary wicking (wicking length, \u223c0.4 mm) that induced faster dry-spot rewetting. The post-treatment of the nanotube surface with stearic acid resulted with hydrophobicity due to alkyl chain adherence to the nanotube pores. The loss of superhydrophilicity increases thermal resistance for pool boiling. Hence, the nanoporous superhydrophilic surface enabled a higher CHF (119 W\/cm2) of 36% than that of the low-surface-energy hydrophobic surface (91 W\/cm2). The experimental results observed here follow the trend of the Liaw and Dhir model accounting surface wettability as the governing factor."},{"title":"The Generation of Three-dimensional Anisotropies in Thin Polymer Films by Angular Selective Photoproduct Formation and Annealing","abstract":"Linearly polarized light can induce an order parallel to the polarization direction of light in polymer films containing different photochromic groups. In principle, this offers the possibility to generate prolate in-plane orders in polymer films. Two such photochemical processes are investigated in this paper. One of them is the irradiation of azobenzene-containing polymer films with linearly polarized red light after an unpolarized UV preirradiation step. The other one is the angular selective photocycloaddition of cinnamate-containing polymer films induced by linearly polarized UV light. Because in both cases the order is low after the irradiation, the liquid crystalline polymer films are annealed in their mesophase to modify the photoinduced order by thermotropic self-organization. The resulting three-dimensional indicatrices, as determined by waveguide spectroscopy, are found to be prolate in-plane, biaxial, or homeotropic in dependence on the polymer structures, preparation conditions, and irradiation conditions of the films.

The results showed that anisotropy would vary with the volume-induced pinning\u2212depinning\u2212repinning behavior of the droplet. Furthermore, through the observation of water response on small Si domain, the adhesive force of the structure is proven to be the key factor giving rise to the anisotropy wetting.

Our results showed that as expected, in contrast to NMEC, BCC were plastic: they tolerated nonadhesion promoting regions, adapted to flow and exploited gradients better. In addition, the number of focal adhesions but not their area appeared to be the dominant parameter for regulation of cell adhesion. Our findings also demonstrated that custom designed protein nanopatterns, which can properly mimic the in vivo microenvironment, enable realistic distinction of normal and cancerous cell adhesion."},{"title":"Quasi-Classical Trajectory Calculations Analyzing the Reactivity and Dynamics of Asymmetric Stretch Mode Excitations of Methane in the H + CH<sub>4<\/sub> Reaction","abstract":"An exhaustive dynamics study was performed at two collision energies, 1.52 and 2.20 eV, analyzing the effects of the asymmetric (\u03bd3) stretch mode excitation in the reactivity and dynamics of the gas-phase H + CH4 reaction. Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations, including corrections to avoid zero-point energy leakage along the trajectories, were performed on an analytical potential energy surface previously developed by our group. First, strong coupling between different vibrational modes in the entry channel was observed, indicating that energy can flow between these modes, and therefore that they do not preserve their adiabatic character along the reaction path; i.e., the reaction is nonadiabatic. Second, we found that the reactant vibrational excitation has a significant influence on the vibrational and rotational product distributions. With respect to the vibrational distribution, our results confirm the purely qualitative experimental evidence, although the theoretical results presented here are also quantitative. The rotational distributions are predictive, because no experimental data have been reported. Third, with respect to the reactivity, we found that the \u03bd3 mode excitation by one quantum is more reactive than the ground state by a factor of about 2, independently of the collision energy, and in agreement with the experimental measurement of 3.0 \u00b1 1.5. Fourth, the state-to-state angular distributions of the products reproduce the experimental behavior at 1.52 eV, where the CH3 products scatter sideways and backward. At 2.20 eV this experimental information is not available, and therefore the results reported here are again predictive. The satisfactory reproduction of a great variety of experimental data by the present QCT study lends confidence to the potential energy surface constructed by our group and to those results whose accuracy cannot be checked by comparison with experiment.

The PA gels show a fast and strong stress relaxation that obeys the stress-optical rule, which could be associated with relaxation of chain segment orientation by the breaking of ionic bonds. A slow and weak relaxation of phase structure (\u223c100 nm) is also observed, which tells that the stress redistributes and local strain amplification gradually builds in the phase network at long relaxation times as a result of synergetic breaking of multiple ionic bonds.

Afterward, hairpin probe modified on the electrode was opened by helper DNA, followed by assembling target to hybridize with the exposed stem of the helper DNA. Significantly, T7 exonuclease was employed to digest the DNA\/RNA duplex and trigger the target recycling without asking for a specific recognition site in the target sequence, realizing a series of RNA\/DNA detections by changing the sequence of the complementary DNA. At last, the ECL signal was further enhanced by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-based 3D DNA networks. After the two amplifications, the ECL signal of GQDs was extraordinarily increased and the prepared biosensor achieved a high sensitivity with the detection limit of 0.83 fM. The biosensor was also explored in real samples, and the result was in good accordance with the performance of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Considering the excellent sensitivity and applicability, we believe that the proposed biosensor is a potential candidate for nucleic acid biosensing."},{"title":"Terahertz Vibration\u2212Rotation-Tunneling Spectroscopy of the Ammonia Dimer:\u2009 Characterization of an out of Plane Vibration","abstract":"The terahertz vibration\u2212rotation-tunneling (VRT) spectrum of the ammonia dimer (NH3)2 has been measured between ca. 78.5 and 91.9 cm-1.

An attractive feature of this tryptophan analogue is its absorbance at 310\u2013320 nm, allowing its specific excitation in a Trp background. The red-shift in absorbance upon introduction of a hydroxyl group at the 5-position of Trp or indole was found to be due to a lowering of the 1Lb transition energy. It was therefore believed that 5HW only features 1Lb emission. Recently, calculations for 5-hydroxyindole (5HI) in water revealed 1La is the emitting state, and the same was predicted for 5HW incorporated in proteins. To clarify which state emits in 5HI and 5HW, we present here excitation anisotropy spectra of these probes and of four proteins labeled with 5HW at a surface exposed position. Our data clearly show 1Lb is the emitting state of 5HI, 5HW, and 5HW in three of the proteins investigated.

The objective was to better understand the influence of the operating conditions on the mixing performance with Newtonian fluids. The experiment setup used allows each shaft to be driven independently. Taking advantage of individual torque-meter on each shaft and a well-developed decolorization technique, it was shown that the speed ratio RN (NMaxblend \/Nhelical ribbon = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) and the rotating mode (up- and down-pumping of the helical ribbon) have the largest influence on the mixing performance and that there is no universal operating mode for minimizing power and mixing time in all conditions or flow regimes. The results are presented in terms of the power consumption and mixing time throughout the laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes. The contribution of each impeller, the variation of flow patterns, the determination of the optimal operating conditions, and the comparison of power constant are discussed."},{"title":"Polymorphism Arising from Differing Rates of Compression of Liquids","abstract":"Crystallization of 2-fluorophenylacetylene at room temperature using high pressure yields three different polymorphs.

Without MsbA present, bacterial cells accumulate a toxic amount of lipid A within their inner membranes. A crystal structure of MsbA was recently obtained that provides an excellent starting point for functional dynamics studies in membranes [Chang, and Roth (2001) Science 293, 1793\u22121800]. Although a structure of MsbA is now available, many questions remain concerning its mechanism of transport. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful approach for characterizing local areas within a large protein structure in addition to detecting and following changes in local structure due to dynamic interactions within a protein. The quaternary structure of the resting state of the MsbA homodimer reconstituted into lipid membranes has been evaluated by SDSL EPR spectroscopy and chemical cross-linking techniques. SDSL and cross-linking results are consistent with the controversial resting state conformation of the MsbA homodimer found in the crystal structure, with the tips of the transmembrane helices forming a dimer interface. The position of MsbA in the membrane bilayer along with the relative orientation of the transmembrane helical bundles with respect to one another has been determined. Characterization of the resting state of the MsbA homodimer is essential for future studies on the functional dynamics of this membrane transporter.

The rate constants for the ozonations of methyl-substituted benzenes were also shown to be linearly correlated with the ionization potentials of the corresponding aromatic substrates. These results together with other related experimental evidences lead us to suggest that the olefinic ozonations proceed via an electron transfer reaction mechanism (Scheme 4). This mechanism explains why the derivatives of p-phenylenediamine can be used as efficient antiozonants to prevent the degradation of rubber products caused by ozone.

This paper examines the influence of oligomer chain length, solvent, and concentration on the formation of nanoscale ribbons on mica substrates from solutions of oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene)s (OPEs) with hexyloxy side chains and thioacetyl end groups. The OPEs are of different molecular chain lengths, in which the numbers of p-dihexyloxyphenyleneethynylene repeat units, n, are 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively, with their two ends capped with 4-thioacetylphenyl alligator groups. The atomic force microscope (AFM) is employed to investigate the thin film morphology and study the self-assembled organizations. Solvent and concentration are found to exert a strong influence on thin film morphology. Under suitable conditions, OPEs with 7 p-dihexyloxyphenyleneethynylene repeat units are driven to form micrometer-long nanoribbons, oriented preferably along the 3-fold symmetry axes of the mica substrate. The cross section of the nanoribbons is composed of 7 molecules as evaluated by AFM characterization. On the other hand, oligomers with shorter chain lengths (n = 1, 3, and 5) produce thin films featuring globular nanoaggregates, chains consisting of elongated grains, and rods, respectively. Plausible reasons for the variation in thin film morphology are discussed, based on the results obtained from investigation of oligomer chain length, solvent, and concentration effects. A subtle balance among molecular size and physicochemical properties of solute molecules, solvent molecules, and substrate is crucial for the formation of desired structures. Among them, oligomer chain length plays a key role in thin film morphology, and the critical number of repeat units in OPE\/poly(p-phenyleneethynylene) molecules for the formation of nanoribbon structures with a molecular cross section is supposed to be 8 or 9.

Meanwhile, the structures of the EM essentially influence the decay. Thereby, the coupling effects of these stimuli and structures should be considered in assessing the decay and further the safety of EMs. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to clarify the atomistic\/molecular details of the coupling effects on the decay and safety mechanisms. In the present work, we perform reactive molecular dynamics simulations in combination with the multiscale shock technique to reveal a shock\u2013preheating\u2013dislocation coupling effect on the decay mechanism of an energetic representative, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX). That is, three factors including shock velocity, preheating temperature, and edge dislocation are accounted as variables for the simulations. Increasing shock velocity and preheating temperature and presenting edge dislocation in crystal both promote the RDX decay. Preheating enhances the shock sensitivity as ascertained experimentally, and the sensitivity enhancement is caused by the elevated potential energy of the RDX molecules because of preheating. Moreover, interestingly, two different shock\u2013preheating\u2013dislocation couplings can possess an equivalent effect on the RDX decay, as they can lead to almost same evolutions of major chemical species, temperature, pressure, and potential energy. All these findings are expected to deepen the insight into the response mechanisms for the EMs against external stimuli, particularly in the case of multiple factors coupled."},{"title":"In Vivo Phycocyanin Flourometry as a Potential Rapid Screening Tool for Predicting Elevated Microcystin Concentrations at Eutrophic Lakes","abstract":"Current approaches for assessing human health risks associated with cyanotoxins often rely on the quantification of microcystin.

To address these challenges, a numerical index for screening microcystin risks above the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) low-risk threshold for microcystin was developed for eutrophic Midwestern U.S. lakes based on water quality results from 182 beach water samples collected from seven Ohio lakes. In 48 (26.4%) samples we observed microcystin concentrations as measured by ELISA that exceeded the 4 \u03bcg\/L microcystin threshold. A multivariable logistic regression model using practical real-time measures of in vivo phycocyanin (by fluorometry) and secchi depth was constructed to estimate the probability of a beach sample exceeding 4 \u03bcg\/L microcystin.

NCKX4 is thought to operate in the surface membrane of cells, whereas NCKX5 is thought to be located in intracellular membranes. However, no functional data have yet been reported to describe either NCKX4 or NCKX5 activity in pigmented cells. In this study, we used the B16 and MEB4 mouse pigmented cell lines to investigate NCKX-mediated Ca2+ fluxes using 45Ca uptake experiments and measurements of changes in intracellular free Ca2+ with the fluorescent Ca2+-indicating dye Fluo-4. We used siRNA-mediated knockdown to selectively reduce either NCKX4 or NCKX5 expression. The results show that both B16 and MEB4 cells contain roughly equal amounts of NCKX4 and NCKX5 transcript, but surface membrane NCKX activity is restricted to NCKX4. Intracellular NCKX4 activity was also observed, but we could not unambiguously detect any NCKX5 activity. We were able to demonstrate that NCKX5 is a functional K+-dependent Na+-Ca2+ exchanger located in internal membranes after transfection of NCKX5 cDNA in HEK293 cells. We conclude that pigment cells express robust, functional NCKX4 activity, but that the role of NCKX5 remains enigmatic ten years after the discovery of its link to pigmentation."},{"title":"Study of SiGe Crystal Growth Interface Processed in Microgravity","abstract":"A Si1\u2013xGex (x \u223c 0.5) crystal measuring 10 mm in diameter was grown by the traveling liquidus zone method using the Gradient Heating Furnace aboard the International Space Station.

To investigate current variance at the interface of transistors, we obtain the low-frequency (LF) noise features of MoTe2 multilayer field-effect transistors with different dielectric environments. The LF noise properties are analyzed using the combined carrier mobility and carrier number fluctuation model which is additionally parametrized with an interfacial Coulomb-scattering parameter (\u03b1) that varies as a function of the accumulated carrier density (Nacc) and the location of the active channel layer of MoTe2. Our model shows good agreement with the current power spectral density (PSD) of MoTe2 devices from a low to high current range and indicates that the parameter \u03b1 exhibits a stronger dependence on Nacc with an exponent \u2212\u03b3 of \u22121.18 to approximately \u22121.64 for MoTe2 devices, compared with \u22120.5 for Si devices. The raised Coulomb scattering of the carriers, particularly for a low-current regime, is considered to be caused by the unique traits of layered semiconductors such as interlayer coupling and the charge distribution strongly affected by the device structure under a gate bias, which completely change the charge screening effect in MoTe2 multilayer. Comprehensive static and LF noise analyses of MoTe2 devices with our combined model reveal that a chemical-vapor deposited h-BN monolayer underneath MoTe2 channel and the Al2O3 passivation layer have a dissimilar contribution to the reduction of current fluctuation. The three-fold enhanced carrier mobility due to the h-BN is from the weakened carrier scattering at the gate dielectric interface and the additional 30% increase in carrier mobility by Al2O3 passivation is due to the reduced interface traps."},{"title":"Structure Making and Breaking Effects of Cations in Aqueous Solution: Nitrous Oxide Pump\u2013Probe Measurements","abstract":"Ultrafast IR pump\u2013probe responses resonant with the \u03bd3 asymmetric stretch of nitrous oxide (N2O) at \u223c2230 cm\u20131 are reported for 2 M aqueous salt solutions of MgCl2, CaCl2, NaCl, KCl, and CsCl at room temperature.

The polymer molecules are modeled as freely jointed chains of charged hard spheres, the counterions and co-ions as charged hard spheres, and the surface is a planar, impenetrable hard wall with a uniform surface charge density. The density functional theory treats the ideal gas contribution exactly, uses a weighted density approximation for the hard sphere contribution, and a generalized van der Waals approximation for the electrostatic contribution. At a fixed surface charge density, with increasing concentration of the polyion, the simulations show layering as well as charge inversion phenomena resulting from an interplay between excluded volume and electrostatic interactions. The integrated surface excess is a monotonically decreasing function of polymer concentration at high surface charge densities, but a nonmonotonic function of polymer concentration at lower surface charge densities. The density functional theory is in qualitative agreement with simulations for the density profiles but fails to capture the layering and charge inversion effects. This suggests that liquid-state correlations and coupling between electrostatic and excluded volume effects are important factors in the adsorption of charged polymers at surfaces.

This occurs via one-electron enzymatic reduction of TPZ to yield an oxygen-sensitive drug radical (2) that leads to oxidatively generated DNA damage under hypoxic conditions. Two possible mechanisms have been considered to account for oxidatively generated DNA damage by TPZ. First, homolysis of the N\u2212OH bond in 2 may yield the well-known DNA-damaging agent, hydroxyl radical. Alternatively, it has been suggested that elimination of water from 2 generates a benzotriazinyl radical (4) as the ultimate DNA-damaging species. In the studies described here, the TPZ analogue 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4-dioxide (5) was employed as a tool to probe the mechanism of DNA damage within this new class of antitumor drugs. Initially, it was demonstrated that 5 causes redox-activated, hypoxia-selective oxidation of DNA and small organic substrates in a manner that is completely analogous to TPZ. This suggests that 5 and TPZ damage DNA by the same chemical mechanism. Importantly, the methyl substituent in 5 provides a means for assessing whether the putative benzotriazinyl intermediate 7 is generated following one-electron reduction. Two complementary isotopic labeling experiments provide evidence against the formation of the benzotriazinyl radical intermediate. Rather, a mechanism involving the release of hydroxyl radical from the activated drug radical intermediates can explain the DNA-cleaving properties of this class of antitumor drug candidates."},{"title":"Decreasing the Rate of Metabolic Ketone Reduction in the Discovery of a Clinical Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Inhibitor for the Treatment of Diabetes","abstract":"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors offer significant potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hepatic steatosis, and cancer. However, the identification of tool compounds suitable to test the hypothesis in human trials has been challenging. An advanced series of spirocyclic ketone-containing ACC inhibitors recently reported by Pfizer were metabolized in vivo by ketone reduction, which complicated human pharmacology projections. We disclose that this metabolic reduction can be greatly attenuated through introduction of steric hindrance adjacent to the ketone carbonyl. Incorporation of weakly basic functionality improved solubility and led to the identification of 9 as a clinical candidate for the treatment of T2DM. Phase I clinical studies demonstrated dose-proportional increases in exposure, single-dose inhibition of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), and changes in indirect calorimetry consistent with increased whole-body fatty acid oxidation. This demonstration of target engagement validates the use of compound 9 to evaluate the role of DNL in human disease."},{"title":"An Extension of the Hirshfeld Method to Open Shell Systems Using Fractional Occupations","abstract":"In this work, a new partitioning method is presented which allows one to calculate properties of radicals, in particular, atomic spin populations. The method can be seen as an extension of the Hirshfeld-I method [Bultinck, P. et al.  J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126, 144111], in which the atomic weight functions, defining the atoms-in-molecules, are constructed by means of an iterative scheme in which the charges of the atoms-in-molecules are altered but the spin remains fixed. The Hirshfeld-I method is therefore not suitable for the calculation of atomic spin populations of open-shell systems. The new fractional occupation Hirshfeld-I (FOHI) uses an iterative scheme in which both the atomic charge and spin are optimized, resulting in a self-consistent method for the calculation of atomic spin populations. The results obtained with the FOHI method are compared with experimental results obtained using polarized neutron diffraction, thus serving as a validation of the FOHI method as well as the Hirshfeld definition of atoms-in-molecules in general."},{"title":"Identification of <i>\u03b1-<\/i>Cobratoxin in Equine Plasma by LC-MS\/MS for Doping Control","abstract":"Cobra venom (Naja kaouthia) contains a toxin called \u03b1-cobratoxin (\u03b1-Cbtx). This toxin is a natural protein containing 71 amino acids (MW 7821 Da) with a reported analgesic potency greater than morphine. In 2007, in USA, this substance was found in the barns of a thoroughbred trainer and since then till date, the lack of a detection of this molecule has remained a recurring problem for the horseracing industry worldwide. To solve this problem, the first method for the detection of \u03b1-cobratoxin in equine plasma has now been developed. Plasma sample (3 mL) was treated with ammonium sulfate at the isoelectric point of \u03b1-Cbtx, and the pellet was dissolved in a phosphate buffer and mixed with methanol for precipitation. The supernatant was then concentrated prior to its extraction on WCX SPE cartridges. The eluate was concentrated with two consecutive filtration steps before the trypsin digestion. The samples were analyzed using a LC-MS\/MS Q Exactive instrument at 70,000 resolution on the product ions of the doubly charged precursor of the target peptide (24TWCDAFCSIR33). The method was validated (n = 18) at 5 \u03bcg\/L (640 pmol\/L) according to the Association of Official Racing Chemists (AORC) requirements. The lower limit of detection was 1 \u03bcg\/L (130 pmol\/L). The present method has made it possible for us to confirm the presence of \u03b1-Cbtx in a horse plasma sample 24 h post the administration of \u03b1-Cbtx. Thus, the present method provides the first sensitive, specific, and reliable analytical method to confirm the presence of \u03b1-Cbtx in equine plasma."},{"title":"Ligand-Mediated Nanocrystal Growth","abstract":"A microfluidic platform combined with a deterministic model accounting for surface ligands reveals precious insights into the nanocrystal formation process.

One was assembled by depositing the complex monolayer of SV\/DNA\/TMPyP, which was in situ formed through the adsorption of aqueous subphase containing DNA and TMPyP onto the spreading SV monolayer (type I). Another was obtained by reacting the preformed SV\/DNA LB film with TMPyP in aqueous solution (type II). A series of methods, such as surface pressure\u2212area isotherms, atomic force microscopy (AFM), polarized UV\u2212vis spectra, circular dichroism (CD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and fluorescence lifetime measurements, were used to characterize these ternary LB films. The isotherm measurement indicated that stable complex monolayers could be formed at the air\u2212water interface through the adsorption between SV and DNA or DNA\/TMPyP. AFM showed different morphologies of type I and type II LB films. Through a series of characterizations on the LB films, it has been found that TMPyP can intercalate and electrostatically bind to DNA and orient differently in type I and type II LB films. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of the LB films indicated that in the type I LB film electron and\/or energy transfer occurred predominantly between the SV and intercalated TMPyP, while in the type II LB film the transfer was predominantly between the SV and electrostatically bound TMPyP. Research showed that the deposition sequence or fabrication method plays an important role in the assembling of ternary LB systems. This method provides a way to fabricate DNA-based molecular assemblies in a controlled and precise manner.

The total isoflavones and total phenol content (TPC) in all the genotypes increased significantly at a dose of 0.5 and 2 kGy respectively. The anthocyanin content was high in Kalitur, while other genotypes showed no detectable amounts of it. The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (HRSA), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) and total antioxidant power (TAP) were highest in Kalitur with black seed coat color. However, maximum enhancement in antioxidant properties was found in NRC37 with yellow followed by Hara soya with green seed coat color at a dose of 0.5 and 2.0 kGy. It was also observed that the 3 soybean genotypes showed an increase in antioxidant constituents and antioxidative properties at lower doses of 0.5 and 2.0 kGy while, the antioxidant effects of soy seeds were either decreased or remained constant at a higher dose of 5.0 kGy. It is suggested that mild gamma irradiation enhanced the antioxidant constituents and, hence, antioxidant potential of soybean seeds."},{"title":"Functional Fluorescently Labeled Bithiazole \u0394F508-CFTR Corrector Imaged in Whole Body Slices in Mice","abstract":"We previously reported the identification and structure\u2013activity analysis of bithiazole-based correctors of defective cellular processing of the cystic fibrosis-causing CFTR mutant, \u0394F508-CFTR. Here, we report the synthesis and uptake of a functional, fluorescently labeled bithiazole corrector. Following synthesis and functional analysis of four bithiazole\u2013fluorophore conjugates, we found that 5, a bithazole-based BODIPY conjugate, had low micromolar potency for correction of defective \u0394F508-CFTR cellular misprocessing, with comparable efficacy to benchmark corrector corr-4a. Intravenous administration of 5 to mice established its stability in extrahepatic tissues for tens of minutes. By fluorescence imaging of whole-body frozen slices, fluorescent corrector 5 was visualized strongly in gastrointestinal organs, with less in lung and liver.

Other complementary techniques, open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), showed changes in the recombination at the photoelectrode\/electrolyte interface.

The H12 cage contains 12 amide NH groups plus four tertiary amine N groups, the latter of which are positioned in a pseudo-tetrahedral array. Crystallographic findings indicate that the tetrahedral host can adopt either a pseudo-C3 symmetric \u201ccompressed tetrahedron\u201d structure, or one in which there are two sets of three stacked pyridine units related by a pseudo-S4 axis. The latter conformation is ideal for encapsulating small pentameric clusters, either a water molecule or a fluoride ion surrounded by a tetrahedral array of water molecules, i.e., H2O\u00b74H2O or F\u2013\u00b74H2O, as observed crystallographically. In solution, however, 19F NMR spectroscopy indicates that H12 encapsulates fluoride ion through direct amide hydrogen bonding. By collectively combining one-dimensional 1H, 13C, and 19F with two-dimensional 1H\u20131H COSY, 1H\u201313C HSQC, and 1H\u201319F HETCOR NMR techniques, the solution binding mode of fluoride can be ascertained as consisting of four sets of independent structural subunits with C3 symmetry.

It is found that the emission spectra display a red shift on going from mononuclear to binuclear to polynuclear structures, and it is tentatively argued that this provides evidence for extended \u03c0-conjugation in the polymers. Many of the model complexes display a red shift in the emission spectra on going from solution in dichloromethane to the solid state; in most cases, this is attributed to the presence of intermolecular Au\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Au bonding in the solid state but, in one case, it is also observed when the intermolecular Au\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Au distance is too long to be consistent with a bonding interaction.
