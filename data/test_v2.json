[{"title":"Experimental Study of the Influence of Nitrogen and Oxygen on the Solubility of Solid Carbon Dioxide in Liquid and Vapor Methane at Low Temperature","abstract":"Undesired solid CO2 formation is a main issue for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry and, more recently, for the bioLNG production. The abundance of CO2 solubility data in liquid methane may not be sufficient to fully understand the problem when important amounts of air gases (O2 and N2) are present in the natural gas or biomethane. Scarcity and incompleteness of available solubility data involving nitrogen and oxygen motivated the production of original solid\u2013liquid\u2013vapor equilibrium (SLVE) data for the N2\u2013CH4\u2013CO2 and N2\u2013O2\u2013CH4\u2013CO2 systems. The solubility limit of CO2 in both liquid and vapor phases is measured in this work to allow the definition of solid formation conditions. A static analytic methodology is used for obtaining (p, T, x, y) data at SLVE in the temperature range from 125 to 146 K. Experimental results obtained in this work show that the addition of nitrogen and oxygen in methane decreases the solubility of CO2 in the liquid phase. A thermodynamic model for the calculation of solid\u2013liquid\u2013vapor equilibrium of the N2\u2013O2\u2013CH4\u2013CO2 system is also presented in this work and compared with experimental data, providing good agreement."},{"title":"Fitting Cometary Sampling and Composition Mass Spectral Results Using Non-negative Least Squares: Reducing Detection Ambiguity for <i>In Situ<\/i> Solar System Organic Compound Measurements","abstract":"The chemistry occurring in the universe generates a huge variety of organic compounds abiotically. Significant progress has been made in understanding the types and distributions of these compounds in various planetary, asteroidal, cometary, nebular, and molecular cloud environments. One of the most exciting recent discoveries was the detection of low-molecular-weight organic species native to the surface of comet 67P\/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko by the cometary sampling and composition experiment that was aboard the Philae lander of the European Space Agency. The identities of these species were estimated using a simple hand-fitting method. Here, we use a more rigorous statistical method to fit the same data and find that there is some variance between results obtained using the two methods. This paper offers recommendations to improve the numerical methods for fitting of mass spectra, which would lead to more confident identification of ambiguous-mass compounds. Such methods may also help maximize the gains of future sampling-driven space missions, to Europa, Titan, Mars and its moons, comets, and asteroids, by filling in gaps in current scientific knowledge regarding electron impact mass spectra of ambiguous-mass compounds."},{"title":"Quantum Chemical Investigations and Bonding Analysis of Iron Complexes with Mixed Cyano and Carbonyl Ligands\u2020","abstract":"The equilibrium structures and vibrational frequencies of the iron complexes [Fe(CN)x(CO)y]q (x = 0\u22126 and y = 0\u22125) have been calculated at the BP86 level of theory. The nature of the Fe\u2212CN and Fe\u2212CO has been analyzed with an energy partitioning method. The calculated Fe\u2212CO bond lengths are in good agreement with the results of X-ray structure analysis whereas the Fe\u2212CN bonds are calculated somewhat longer than the experimental values. The theoretically predicted vibrational frequencies of the C\u2212O stretching mode are always lower and the calculated CN- frequencies are higher than the observed fundamental modes. The results of the bonding analysis suggest that the Fe\u2212CO binding interactions have \u223c55% electrostatic character and \u223c45% covalent character. There is a significant contribution of the \u03c0 orbital interaction to the Fe\u2212CO covalent bonding which increases when the complexes become negatively charged. The strength of \u0394E\u03c0 may even be larger than \u0394E\u03c3. The Fe\u2212CN- bonds have much less \u03c0 character. The calculated binding energy of the Fe\u2212CO \u03c0-interactions correlates very well with the C\u2212O stretching frequencies.

An Important Correlation between Pseudorotation and Maximum Amplitude","abstract":"The synthesis and biological evaluation of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexene nucleoside designed as a conformational mimic of the anti-HIV agent stavudine (1, D4T) is described. The unsaturated methanocarbocyclic pseudosugar of N-MCD4T (2) was constructed from an iodo-substituted precursor by a DBU-catalyzed olefination reaction. Mitsunobu coupling with N3-benzoylthymine afforded the desired target after deprotection. Both D4T and N-MCD4T are in the North (N) hemisphere of the pseudorotational cycle but 70\u00b0 away from a perfect N (P = 0\u00b0) conformation toward the East and West hemispheres, respectively. Despite this large difference, the double bond reduces the puckering amplitude (\u03bdmax) of N-MCD4T to 6.81\u00b0, and the superposition of both structures showed a RMS deviation of only 0.039 \u00c5. The combined structural analysis of P and \u03bdmax shows that while the value of P may differ substantially, the low \u03bdmax resolves the differences and becomes the dominant pseudorotational parameter. N-MCD4T is active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 in CEM, MT-2, and MT-4 cells, and while it is somewhat less potent than D4T, it also appears to be less toxic. The triphosphate (N-MCD4TTP) inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase with a 10-fold higher IC50 than D4TTP. By virtue of its carbocyclic nature, N-MCD4T (2) is a more robust molecule stable to conditions that would cleave D4T.

The preparations are conveniently carried out as one-pot reactions. The reaction of 2a\u2212d with B(C6F5)3 in toluene solution at \u221278 \u00b0C proceeds quantitatively to give the thermally unstable zwitterionic complexes CpRZr(\u03b73-allyl){\u03b71:\u03b73-CH2CMeCHCH2B(C6F5)3} (3a\u2212d), which on warming decompose under C\u2212H activation and propene elimination to give CpRZr(C6F5){\u03b74-CH2CMeCHCHB(C6F5)2} (4a\u2212d). The complexes are stabilized by the coordination of one o-F atom of a boryl\u2212C6F5 ring to the metal center. Compounds 4 are fluxional. The rotation of the Zr\u2212C6F5 ligand is influenced by the steric demand of the Cp ligands (\u0394G\u29e7 = 43\u221249 kJ mol-1), while there is little variation in the rotational barriers of the B\u2212C6F5 substituents (\u0394G\u29e7 = ca. 47 kJ mol-1). Recrystallization of 4a from diethyl ether affords the 16-electron complex 4a\u00b7OEt2, in which fluorine coordination is replaced by an ether ligand. The structure of this complex has been determined; unlike its C5Me5 and C5H3(SiMe3)2 congeners, it shows the boryldiene moiety to occupy a prone (endo) conformation. Propene inserts into the CH2 terminus of the boryldiene ligand under ambient conditions to give the metallacycles CpRZr(C6F5){\u03b71:\u03b73-CH2CH(Me)\u2212CH2C(Me)CHCHB(C6F5)2} (5a\u2212d), with complete regioselectivity and very high stereoselectivity.

For weak interaction, the time-dependent transition rates have a form of the Marcus electron-transfer rate. For larger interactions, the transition rates take into account the saturation effect similar to the transition rates in the solvent-controlled theory of electron-transfer reactions. The developed theory is a good approximation to a more sophisticated treatment (J. Chem. Phys. 1998, 109, 4523) which reproduces the effects observed in recent chirped pulse experiments.

Both published experimental results and calculations based on self-consistent field theory were used to convert the concentrations of adsorbed polymer to surface tension. The modeling could predict the slopes of surface tension versus log time curves; however, the times scales for surface tension lowering could not be modeled for a series of polymer concentrations using a single set of model parameters. Oscillating drop experiments in which the surface area of pendent drops was varied sinusoidally by pumping solution in and out of the drop were modeled. The experimental steady-state surface tension oscillations were less than the predicted values, indicating that the adsorbed layer could reconfigure to compensate for an expanding interface.

An important part of the development of novel thin film solar cell technologies, that is still considered a bottleneck for both theory and experiment, is the search for alternative interfacial contact (buffer) layers. The research and development of contact materials is difficult due to the inherent complexity that arises from its interactions at the interface with the absorber. A promising alternative to the commonly used CdS buffer layer in thin film solar cells that contain absorbers with lower electron affinity can be found in \u03b2-In2S3. However, the synthesis conditions for the sputter deposition of this material are not well-established. Here, In2S3 is investigated as a solar cell contact material utilizing a high-throughput combinatorial screening of the temperature-flux parameter space, followed by a number of spatially resolved characterization techniques. It is demonstrated that, by tuning the sulfur partial pressure, phase pure \u03b2-In2S3 could be deposited using a broad range of substrate temperatures between 500 \u00b0C and ambient temperature. Combinatorial photovoltaic device libraries with Al\/ZnO\/In2S3\/Cu2ZnSnS4\/Mo\/SiO2 structure were built at optimal processing conditions to investigate the feasibility of the sputtered In2S3 buffer layers and of an accelerated optimization of the device structure. The performance of the resulting In2S3\/Cu2ZnSnS4 photovoltaic devices is on par with CdS\/Cu2ZnSnS4 reference solar cells with similar values for short circuit currents and open circuit voltages, despite the overall quite low efficiency of the devices (\u223c2%). Overall, these results demonstrate how a high-throughput experimental approach can be used to accelerate the development of contact materials and facilitate the optimization of thin film solar cell devices."},{"title":"Obtaining Detailed Structural Information about Supramolecular Systems on Surfaces by Combining High-Resolution Force Microscopy with <i>ab Initio<\/i> Calculations","abstract":"State-of-the art experimental techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy have great difficulties in extracting detailed structural information about molecules adsorbed on surfaces.

Based on a comparison with an explicit representation of random copolymers, the principles of a mean-field approximation using only the properties of homopolymers have been established. The approach was successfully validated against the Flory\u2013Huggins coefficients collected by Fornasiero et al. [AIChE J. 2002] for 19 aromatic solutes in ethylene-vinyl acetate with acetylation rates varying from 33% to 100%. The role of substituents and isomerism is elucidated.

The chemical leaching method was used to characterize the forms of arsenic in the raw coal and the chars. The effect of minerals on arsenic release was also studied. It was found that about 72% arsenic in YM coal is bound to sulfide species; 16% to sulfates, phosphates, or oxides; 10% to organic species; and 2% to aluminosilicates. The organic-bound arsenic is the most releasable, while the aluminosilicates-bound arsenic is the least releasable. Aluminosilicates inhibit arsenic release due to the formation of aluminosilicates-bound arsenic during pyrolysis. Sulfides, sulfates, phosphates, or oxides may also restrain arsenic release. Carbonates and ion exchangeable minerals in Yima coal do not show any significant influence on the release of arsenic during coal pyrolysis. Secondary reactions between arsenic and the coal matrix should exist, as evidenced by significant increase in organic-bound arsenic in chars obtained from pyrolysis in a temperature range of 300\u2212700 \u00b0C."},{"title":"Study of Morphology and Phase Diagram of \u03c0-Shaped ABC Block Copolymers Using Self-Consistent-Field Theory","abstract":"Using a combinatorial screening method based on the self-consistent-field theory for polymers, we study the bulk morphology and the phase behavior of \u03c0-shaped ABC block copolymers, in which A is the backbone and B and C are the two grafts. By systematically varying the positions of the graft points, the \u03c0-shaped block copolymer can change from a star block copolymer to a linear ABC block copolymer. Thus, the corresponding order\u2212order phase transition due to the architecture variation can be investigated. At two given compositions, we find seven different morphologies (\u201cthree-color\u201d lamellar phase, \u201cthree-color\u201d hexagonal honeycomb phase, lamellae with beads inside, dodecagon\u2212hexagon\u2212tetragon, hexagon\u2212hexagon, lamellae with alternating beads, and octagon\u2212octagon\u2212tetragon). The hexagon\u2212hexagon morphology has not been reported previously for linear and star triblock copolymers in the bulk state. The phase diagram of the \u03c0-shaped ABC block copolymer with symmetric interactions among the three species is constructed. When the volume fractions of block B and block C are equal, the triangle phase diagram shows reflection symmetry. When the shorter block is fixed at the backbone end and the other block moves to the other end along the backbone, the resulting morphology reaches to the same as that of a linear triblock copolymer rapidly. These results may help the design of the microstructures of complex block copolymers.

The ability of par3 PDZ domains to target various adhesion molecules and enzymes at the plasma membrane leads to the controlled localization of par6 and aPKC, which has firmly established its role in epithelial cell polarity. Of the numerous PDZ ligands associated with par3, interaction of its third PDZ domain with the class II ligand found within the C-terminal tail of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-Cad) suggests a role in endothelial cell polarity as well, but the molecular details of the interaction are unknown. Previously determined structures of par3-PDZ3 bound to the class I ligand found within the C-terminal tail of the phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN revealed two discrete binding sites: a canonical PDZ\u2212ligand interaction site and a distal site involving charge\u2212charge complements. Currently, it is unclear if par3-PDZ3 employs both canonical and distal binding modes in its association with VE-Cad or if these modes are unique to the PTEN interaction, suggesting a possible mechanism for ligand specificity within the polarity network. The structure of par3-PDZ3 bound to the C-terminal tail of VE-Cad presented in this work shows that both canonical and distal interactions are utilized in binding. Biophysical measurements using fluorescence polarization and two-dimensional NMR implicate the intermolecular charge pairing of aspartic acid 777 (VE-Cad) and arginine 609 (par3-PDZ3) as a crucial modulator of complex formation. Phosphorylation of VE-Cad at serine 776 increases its affinity for par3, demonstrating that post-translational modifications outside of the canonical carboxylate binding site can enhance PDZ\u2212ligand interactions. Comparison of the VE-Cad and PTEN complexes highlights how the unique molecular architecture of par3-PDZ3 can accommodate both canonical and distal interaction modes that allow dual-class specificity for these two ligand types."},{"title":"Hydrogen Bonds in Membrane Proteins","abstract":"Hydrogen bonds are essential tie points inside protein structures. They undergo dynamic rupture and rebonding processes on the time scale of tens of picoseconds. Proteins can partially rearrange during such ruptures. In previous work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of these fluctuating hydrogen bonds. This indicated long-range entropy and energy contributions extending far into the liquid environment. The results showed that the binding of a given hydrogen bond is much reduced as a result of these interactions in water, as is required for biological activity and in very good confirmation of known experimental results. The larger water environment directly interacts with the hydrogen bond essentially due to long-range molecular interactions. Such a substantial lowering of the energy of the hydrogen bond in water brings it into the range of activation by many biological processes (Sheu et al.  Chem. Phys. Lett. 2008, 462, 1\u22125). Thus, the water medium profoundly increases the rate. Furthermore, very large entropic changes are associated with the rupture of hydrogen bonds in water, whereas no such effects are seen for the isolated molecule. Interestingly, such an increase in rates in water is still accompanied by a large negative change in entropy in the extended solvent environment, and this reduces the rate by some 2 orders of magnitude. Recent molecular dynamics experiments in D2O substantiate this model and show a large solvent isotope effect. In this work, we used lipids as the environment for the hydrogen bond and discovered that the energy is also reduced from that found in the isolated molecule, but not as far as in water. On the other hand, we found that no entropy penalty exists for breaking the hydrogen bond in lipids, as seen for water. These two effects compensate, even though the energy is some 2 times larger. The entropic penalty is reduced such that the rate is higher than in water despite the higher energy. This is a significant result for understanding the reactivity and dynamics of proteins in lipids. It should be noted that these are very important solvent effects on entropies and free energies that are not usually reflected in statistical thermodynamic computations for reactants and products. The very long-range effect of the solvent makes substantial contributions to kinetic rate constants and is readily evaluated in this kinetic method. To ignore these long-range environmental effects on the entropy can lead to very spurious results when calculating rates of protein mobilities. Hence, the results not only agree very well with the known hydrogen-bond energies directly as a result of various environmental factors, but even correctly predict a phase transition in the lipid."},{"title":"Embedding Sodium Ions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride Vacancies for Visible Light Photocatalytic H<sub>2<\/sub> Evolution","abstract":"In this work, through first-principles density functional theory calculations, Na ions embedded in the vacancies of the aromatic ring plane of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were predicted to bridge the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and subsequently enhance its photocatalytic activity.

The formation of coordinative Na\u2013N bonds with the N atoms at the edge of aromatic rings resulted in a bridge that facilitated the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers, changed the electronic band structure of g-C3N4, enhanced the separation degree of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and increased the visible light absorption, thus realizing efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light. The hydrogen evolution rate of 10 mg of photocatalyst 10Na\/CN reached 17.4 \u03bcmol\/h under visible light irradiation with \u03bb &gt; 420 nm, which was about 12.8 and 35.0 times higher than those of Nw\/CN nanowires and Bulk\/CN, respectively."},{"title":"Defect Passivation of Organic\u2013Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites by Diammonium Iodide toward High-Performance Photovoltaic Devices","abstract":"The polycrystalline feature of solution-processed perovskite film and its ionic nature inevitably incur substantial crystallographic defects, especially at the film surface and the grain boundaries (GBs).

The molecular structure of the used diammonium iodide was discovered to play a critical role in affecting the phase purity of treated MAPbI3. Both NH3I(CH2)4NH3I and NH3I(CH2)2O(CH2)2NH3I (EDBE) induce three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) perovskite phase transformation during the treatment while only NH3I(CH2)8NH3I (C8) successfully passivates perovskite surface and GBs without forming 2D perovskite because of the elevated activation energy arising from its unique anti\u2013gauche isomerization. Defect passivation of MAPbI3 was clearly confirmed by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies, which results in the reduced recombination loss in derived devices.

Lignosulfonates face strong competition from synthetic petroleum-based plasticizers with superior quality. Therefore, increasing the performance of lignosulfonates is desirable not only from a sustainability point of view but also to expand their usage. One important aspect that describes how well lignosulfonates can act as plasticizers is the molecular weight.

In the present study, we have developed an improved protocol for the purification of DNP-SG ATPase and investigated its kinetic and substrate-binding properties. The purification procedure was based on highly specific elution of the 38 kDa protein from DNP-SG affinity resin in the presence of ATP. The protein could not be eluted using either ADP or adenosine-5\u2018-[\u03b2,\u03b3-methylene]triphosphate (methylene-ATP), a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP. Doxorubicin (DOX), a weakly basic anthracycline chemotherapy agent, was found to be the preferred activator for stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme. ATP binding to the enzyme was demonstrated using 8-azido-ATP photoaffinity labeling and binding of trinitrophenyl (TNP)-ATP, a fluorescent analogue of ATP. The photoaffinity labeling of DNP-SG ATPase (38 kDa) was saturable with respect to 8-azido ATP (Kd = 2 \u03bcM), indicating that the enzyme was capable of specific and saturable binding to ATP. DNP-SG binding was evident from the purification procedure itself and was also demonstrable by quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. Results of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence as well as radioactive isotope-binding studies indicated that DOX was bound to the purified protein as well.

Poly(ethylene glycol)-l-poly(alanine) thermogel was used in this study. The polypeptide forms a rather robust gel, and the degradation products are a neutral amino acid, which provides cyto-compatible neutral pH environments during the cell culture. During the heat-induced sol-to-gel transition at 37 \u00b0C, tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) and iron ions were incorporated, leading to the formation of a three-dimensional matrix toward neuronal differentiation of the incorporated TMSCs. The initial concentration of the iron ions was varied between 0, 15, 30, and 60 mM. About 10% of the loaded iron ions was released over 21 days, which continuously supplied iron ions to the cells. The incorporation of iron ions not only increased the gel modulus at 37 \u00b0C from 107 to 680 Pa, but also promoted cell aggregation with a significant secretion of the cell adhesion signal of FAK. Expression of biomarkers related to the neuronal differentiation of TMSCs, including NFM, MAP2, GFAP, NURR1, NSE, and TUBB3, increased 4\u201335-fold at the mRNA level in the Fe3+-containing system compared to that of the system without Fe3+. Immunofluorescence studies also confirmed pronounced cell aggregation and a significant increase in neuronal biomarkers at the protein level. This study suggests that an iron ion-releasing thermogelling system can be a promising injectable scaffold toward neuronal differentiation of stem cells."},{"title":"Oxidation of Microcystin-LR by Ferrate(VI): Kinetics, Degradation Pathways, and Toxicity Assessments","abstract":"The presence of the potent cyanotoxin, microcystin-LR (MC-LR), in drinking water sources poses a serious risk to public health.

Detailed product studies using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS\/MS) indicated the oxidized products (OPs) were primarily the result of hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, double bond of the methyldehydroalanine (Mdha) amino acid residue, and diene functionality. Products studies also indicate fragmentation of the cyclic MC-LR structure occurs under the reaction conditions. The analysis of protein phosphatase (PP1) activity suggested that the degradation byproducts of MC-LR did not possess significant biological toxicity. Fe(VI) was effective for the degradation MC-LR in water containing carbonate ions and fulvic acid (FA) and in lake water samples, but higher Fe(VI) dosages would be needed to completely remove MC-LR in lake water compared to deionized water."},{"title":"(1<i>S<\/i>)-1-[(4<i>R<\/i>)-2,2-Dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]-2-hydroxyethylammonium Benzoate, A Versatile Building Block for Chiral 2-Aminoalkanols:\u2009 Concise Synthesis and Application to Nelfinavir, a Potent HIV-Protease Inhibitor","abstract":"A concise synthesis of a versatile chiral C4 building block for 2-aminoalkanols, (1S)-1-[(4R)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]-2-hydroxyethylammonium benzoate (1a), was described. 1 (1a and its enantiomer 1b) acted as four stereoisomers of optically active 2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol.

The activity of these materials was extremely enhanced when a platinum counter electrode was used instead of a graphite rod and reached the level of commercial Pt\/C electrodes. Postreaction scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of electrode surfaces revealed that incorporation of even extremely low amounts of Pt resulted in this considerable gain of HER activity. High resolution XPS analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that pyridinic nitrogen atoms act as active sites for Pt coordination and deposition.

While the hydrate equilibrium pressure is an intensive property, it is demonstrated that the presence of a broad pore-size distribution in a porous medium causes the experimental pressures to appear extensive. It is observed that the sample size, the headspace volume, the temperature at which the experiments are started, and the amount of hydrate allowed to dissociate to establish equilibrium at this initial temperature all affect the observed pressure at any given temperature. The pore-volume distribution of the porous medium (not the nominal pore radius) and the percent conversion of pore-water to hydrate also affect the measured equilibrium pressures. As a result, measured equilibrium pressures at a specific temperature for identical media can be significantly different, while those for different media may be superposed. These seeming inconsistencies, their causes, and interpretations are examined and explained. Apparently fundamental problems in experimental data are removed when the number of degrees of freedom is properly included in the interpretation.

The effective application of MOF NPs, however, is often hampered by limited control of their surface chemistry and understanding of their interactions at the biointerface. Using a surface coating approach, we found that coordinative polymer binding to Zr-fum NPs is a convenient way for peripheral surface functionalization. Different polymers with biomedical relevance were assessed for the ability to bind to the MOF surface. Carboxylic acid and amine containing polymers turned out to be potent surface coatings and a modulator replacement reaction was identified as the underlying mechanism. The strong binding of polycarboxylates was then used to shield the MOF surface with a double amphiphilic polyglutamate\u2013polysarcosine block copolymer, which resulted in an exceptional high colloidal stability of the nanoparticles. The effect of polymer coating on interactions at the biointerface was tested with regard to cellular association and protein binding, which has, to the best of our knowledge, never been discussed in literature for functionalized MOF NPs. We conclude that the applied approach enables a high degree of chemical surface confinement, which could be used as a universal strategy for MOF NP functionalization. In this way, the physicochemical properties of MOF NPs could be tuned, which allows for control over their behavior in biological systems."},{"title":"Evidence of Specific Interactions between Laser-Polarized Xenon and Arenesulfonic Acid Groups in Functionalized SBA-15 Materials","abstract":"SBA-15 samples functionalized with different arenesulfonic organic contents and prepared at 373 K were characterized by hyperpolarized 129Xe NMR spectroscopy. Variable-temperature measurements provide information on the organic groups distribution in the materials and on Xe diffusion in the mesopores. The heat of adsorption of xenon on the surface as well as its chemical shift value in interaction with the surface are deduced from the temperature dependence of the 129Xe chemical shift. The arenesulfonic group surface coverage was determined, and consequently, the \u201corganic phase\u201d contribution to the shielding constant was estimated. The evolution of the chemical shift with pressure allowed us to evaluate the \u201cxenon\u2212organic phase\u201d interactions and hence distinguish the different organic contents. The slope of the pressure chemical shift dependence reveals the way in which the functionalization process took place. For low organic content (0.05 and 0.10), the slope is negative, indicating the presence of shallow micropores, while for high organic content (0.15 and 0.20), the chemical shift remains unchanged with the pressure showing that the modified mesoporous surface is homogeneous and micropores exempt.

When dissolved in DMSO (the solubilizing agent used in preclinical trials), the dimer cleaves into monomeric DMSO-ligated Ru subunits; the rate of this reaction and behavior of the products formed are thus highly relevant to the efficacy of CORM-2 in vivo. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to monitor this reaction in DMSO and also to monitor the reactivity of CORM-2 and of the monomeric DMSO-ligated derivatives in mouse serum. While the CORM-2 dimer readily liberates CO in mouse serum under ambient conditions, the monomeric Ru subunits formed in DMSO solution do not. This demonstrates that a substantial fraction of the CO-delivery agent being introduced via DMSO solutions would appear to be, in fact, inactive. Photochemical irradiation readily liberates CO from the inactive species, and thus a combined thermal\u2013photochemical approach can greatly improve the yield of CO delivery. Ultrafast experiments indicate that CO loss from the DMSO-ligated monomers is a primary photochemical process. Viewing these results for the popular CORM-2 as a series of proof-of-principle observations, these results demonstrate that predissolution of a CO-RM in any solvent may generate products that are no longer physiologically active, and thus the time between dissolution and injection should always be carefully monitored; this has been seldom reported or considered in CO-RM studies to date. Although a combined thermal\u2013photochemical CO-release approach has not been taken previously, we demonstrate that such an approach is practically quite useful for one of the most popular CO-RMs currently being studied, and thus it is clear that such an approach will be needed to achieve the full potential of many current and future CO-RMs."},{"title":"Synthesis, Characterization, and Substitution Chemistry of [Bu<sub>4<\/sub>N]<sub>2<\/sub>[W<sub>6<\/sub>Cl<sub>8<\/sub>(OSO<sub>2<\/sub>CF<sub>3<\/sub>)<sub>6<\/sub>].

Fresh-freezing and formalin-fixation were tested for the gland to obtain intact tissue sections. Subsequently, MSI was conducted with 12 \u03bcm pixel resolution for both types of preparations, and the lateral distributions of the metabolites were identified. Experiments revealed that lipids belonging to the classes of PC, SM, PE, PS, PA, and TG are present in the venom gland. PC (32:0) and SM (36:1) were found to be specifically located in the areas where cells are present. The snake venom metalloprotease inhibitor pEKW (m\/z 444.2233) was identified in the venom by top-down LC\u2013MS\/MS and localized by MALDI-MSI in the gland across secretory epithelial cells. The peptide can inhibit the venom\u2019s enzymatic activity during long-term storage within the venom gland.

A significant enantiomeric excess was observed upon reaction of compound 1a to its photocyclization products at \u221255 \u00b0C employing lactam 4 as a chiral complexing agent in toluene as the solvent (66% yield).

An additional rinsing step with tap water and cooling of the sanitizing solutions, which are obvious for the fresh-cut industry, were not performed within the current study. The high doses of sodium hypochlorite and peroxyacetic acid tested within this study do not conform to the normally used concentrations within the fresh-cut industry. Neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water (30 mg L\u22121), peroxyacetic acid (250 mg L\u22121), and gaseous chlorine dioxide significantly reduced the total aerobic plate count of cut lettuce in comparison with water wash treatments alone. None of the treatments significantly affected the sensory quality of the lettuce, although small color changes were observed after colorimetric measurements. From a nutritional point of view water rinsing significantly decreased the vitamin C (maximum 35%) and phenol (maximum 17%) contents, but did not affect the carotenoid and \u03b1-tocopherol contents. Additional effects caused by adding a sanitizer to the wash water were not observed for vitamin C and phenols. Conversely, washing with 250 mg L\u22121 peroxyacetic acid reduced the \u03b2-carotene content by about 30%, whereas using 200 mg L\u22121 sodium hypochlorite reduced both the lactucaxanthin and the lutein contents by about 60%. Use of gaseous chlorine dioxide also had an impact on the lutein content (\u221218%). Furthermore, the \u03b1-tocopherol content was reduced by 19.7 and 15.4% when the two concentrations of neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water were used, respectively. These data represent the situation on day 0. In a next phase, shelf-life studies considering microbial and sensory quality and nutrient content should be conducted."},{"title":"Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Single-File Systems","abstract":"The diffusion of particles in single-file systems is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation.

By the mutation of G101A, the catalytic efficiencies of the enzyme for bulky amino acid residues in P2 site such as valine and leucine drastically decreased by excluding the P2 side chain. By the mutation of G101V, even the side chain of the methyl group of the alanine and the side chain of proline were excluded, while the catalytic efficiency toward glycine residue was retained. The enzyme was altered to be glycine preferable. The mutation of G101L reduced catalytic efficiencies for any substrate including glycine which is corresponding to the main chain of the peptide substrate. The strategies we have adopted in this paper are applicable to all subtilisin-related enzymes.

The objective of this study was to determine the kinetics of the biotransformation of maleylacetone (MA), an analogue of the natural substrate maleylacetoacetate, and chlorofluoroacetic acid (CFA) by polymorphic variants of recombinant hGSTZ1-1. The kcat of the four variants of hGSTZ1-1 with MA as the substrate followed the order:\u2009 1c-1c &gt; 1b-1b &gt; 1d-1d &gt; 1a-1a whereas the kcat for the biotransformation of CFA followed the order:\u2009 1a-1a &gt; 1b-1b \u223c 1c-1c \u223c 1d-1d. The turnover rates of MA were much higher than those of CFA for each variant and ranged from 22-fold (1a-1a) to 980-fold differences (1c-1c). The catalytic efficiencies of hGSTZ1-1 variants with MA as the substrate were much greater than those with CFA as the substrate, but little difference among the polymorphic variants was observed. MA was a mixed inhibitor of all variants with CFA as substrate:\u2009 the mean competitive inhibition constant (KicMA) for all variants was about 100 \u03bcM, and the mean uncompetitive inhibition constant (KiuMA) was about 201 \u03bcM. Hence, MA and \u03b1-haloacids apparently compete for the same active site on the enzyme. DCA-induced inactivation of the four variants showed that the inactivated enzymes show markedly reduced isomerase activities. The residual activities were different for each variant:\u2009 1a-1a (12%) &gt; 1b-1b \u223c 1c-1c \u223c 1d-1d (&lt;5%). This is the first kinetic analysis of polymorphic variants of hGSTZ1-1, and the similarity of the kinetic constants for hGSTZ1-1 variants with either MA or CFA as substrates indicates that few differences in DCA-induced perturbations of tyrosine metabolism would likely be observed in humans.

By use of vacuum ultraviolet irradiation (VUV, 172 nm) and ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide UV(254 nm)\/H2O2, it was established that CHA undergoes degradation through a peroxyl radical. In both processes the decay of the peroxyl radical leads predominantly to the formation of 4-oxo-CHA, and minor amounts of hydroxy-CHA (detected only in UV\/H2O2). In UV\/H2O2, additional 4-oxo-CHA may also have been formed by direct reaction of the oxyl radical with H2O2. The oxyl radical can be formed during decay of the peroxyl-CHA radical or reaction of hydroxy-CHA with hydroxyl radical. Oxo- and hydroxy-CHA further degraded to various dihydroxy-CHAs. Scission of the cyclohexane ring was also observed, on the basis of the observation of acyclic byproducts including heptadioic acid and various short-chain carboxylic acids. Overall, the hydroxyl radical induced degradation of CHA proceeded through several steps, involving more than one hydroxyl radical reaction, thus efficiency of the UV\/H2O2 reaction will depend on the rate of generation of hydroxyl radical throughout the process. In real applications to OSPW, concentrations of H2O2 will need to be carefully optimized and the environmental fate and effects of the various degradation products of naphthenic acids considered."},{"title":"Polytypic InP Nanolaser Monolithically Integrated on (001) Silicon","abstract":"On-chip optical interconnects still miss a high-performance laser monolithically integrated on silicon.

It was found that catalytic activity of the (Pt\u2013Mo) nanoparticles depends upon (i) the selectivity and reactivity of different atomic sites at the surface that may significantly affect the kinetics of different stages of the FT synthesis and (ii) the optimal composition of the NP allowing increasing the methane production at the first stage of the FT synthesis. This work highlights the main mechanisms that govern bimetallic catalyst activity for the FT synthesis. Similar considerations could be developed for any bimetallic catalytic system and any catalytic reactions.

As evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy, the oxygen chamber pressure considerably affected the lattice deformation in the AGO materials. Under high oxygen pressure, the lattice deformation reduced the d-spacing of the AGO(\u2212201) plane. In the measured transmittance spectra of the AGO films, this narrowing of the d-spacing in the main plane manifested as a high-energy shift of the absorption edge. The AGO films were then installed as the active layers in the metal\u2013semiconductor\u2013metal photodetectors (PDs). The lattice deformation was observed to enhance the photocurrent and reduce the dark current of the device. The responsivity was 20.7 times higher in the lattice-deformed AGO-based PD sample than that in the nondeformed sample. It appeared that the lattice deformation induced the separation of the piezopotential, improving the efficiency of the photogenerated carrier recombination and, consequently, shortening the decay time of the photodetector."},{"title":"Solvent-Mediated Intragranular-Coarsening of CH<sub>3<\/sub>NH<sub>3<\/sub>PbI<sub>3<\/sub> Thin Films toward High-Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics","abstract":"The deposition of dense and uniform perovskite films with large grains is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). High-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films were produced by a self-induced intragranular-coarsening approach. The perovskite precursor solution contained a Lewis base, N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and was deposited using a gas-assisted, one-step, spin-coating method that was followed by a solvent vapor-assisted annealing treatment using a mix of DMSO and chlorobenzene (CBZ). Combining solvent-engineering with gas-assisted deposition helps to form intermediate crystalline entities upon evaporation of the parent solvent but retards the otherwise fast reaction between the precursor ingredients. Subsequent cosolvent annealing induces further grain-coarsening via a facilitated dissolution\u2013precipitation process. This technique produced flat CH3NH3PbI3 films featuring large grain microstructures, with well-coarsened subgrains and a reduction of intragranular defects that minimized carrier recombination.

First, on the basis of the phenomenon of GAGs dose-dependently inhibiting the fluorescence quenching of ScGFP by graphene oxide, a simple and highly sensitive signal-on homogeneous platform was established for detecting and quantifying GAGs, even in complex samples such as heparin in citrated plasma and oversulfated chondroitin sulfate in heparin.

Surprisingly, the abundance of Ne2Au+, which is predicted to have zero covalent bonding character and no enhanced stability, features a local maximum, too. The predicted size and structure of complete solvation shells surrounding ions with essentially nondirectional bonding depends primarily on the ratio \u03c3* of the ion\u2013ligand versus the ligand\u2013ligand distance. For Au+ solvated in helium and neon, the ratio \u03c3* is slightly below 1, favoring icosahedral packing in agreement with a maximum observed in the corresponding abundance distributions at n = 12. HenAu+ appears to adopt two additional solvation shells of Ih symmetry, containing 20 and 12 atoms, respectively. For ArnAu+, with \u03c3* \u2248 0.67, one would expect a solvation shell of octahedral symmetry, in agreement with an enhanced ion abundance at n = 6.

Recently, much attention has been focused on sphingoid bases because of their potentially beneficial bioactivities toward various cancer cells as well as their dietary interest. However, low abundance and the handling complexity caused by their amphiphilic character led to very limited research on them. Glutaraldehyde has two aldehyde groups, and it reacts rapidly with the 2-amino-1,3-diol functional group of sphingosine to give a tricyclic product. Immobilization of glutaraldehyde on a resin was successfully performed by organic synthesis, starting from trans-p-coumaric acid via eight steps. This approach suppresses the self-polymerization of glutaraldehyde, and addition of water to the developed resin causes the formation of cyclic double hemiacetal function, which avoids oxidation like a reducing sugar in nature and makes it stable even for up to 1 year incubation. The resin was applied to the solid-phase extracting experiment of free sphingosine from human serum at a concentration of 280 nM. Another extraction study of edible golden oyster mushrooms showed that the sphingoid base was selectively captured from complex natural extracts. These results demonstrate that the developed glutaraldehyde resin method is a highly selective method, and hence, the combination of it with the o-phthaldialdehyde HPLC method was confirmed as an efficient and sensitive method for analysis of sphingoid bases in biological samples."},{"title":"Oxidative DNA Damage Preventive Activity and Antioxidant Potential of <i>Stevia rebaudiana<\/i> (Bertoni) Bertoni, a Natural Sweetener","abstract":"At 0.1 mg\/mL, the ethyl acetate extract (EAE) of the crude 85% methanolic extract (CAE) of Stevia rebaudiana leaves exhibited preventive activity against DNA strand scission by \u2022OH generated in Fenton\u2019s reaction on pBluescript II SK (\u2013) DNA.

In the case of the Pd SAM, similar air exposure does not result in incorporation of oxygen or loss of solvent resistance but rather results in a chemically altered interface which is attributed to polymerization of the \u2212NC moieties to quasi-2D poly(imine) structures. Conductance probe atomic force microscope measurements show the conductance of the degraded Pd SAMs can diminish by \u223c2 orders of magnitude, an indication that the SAM\u2212Pd electrical contact has severely degraded.

DHN can be produced by hydrogenating nepetalactone (NL), which is the primary ingredient of the essential oil obtained from the renewably sourced catmint plant, Nepeta cataria. Optimizing the hydrogenation reaction to produce DHN from catmint oil is a key economic driver for the process. Prior to the study described here, Six Sigma methodologies were used to select palladium on carbon (5% Pd\/C) as the catalyst of choice. The hydrogenation step was studied as a function of critical process variables and the composition of the oil. As described in this article, a robust, two-step hydrogenation process was developed to maximize the yield of the desired DHNs from treated catmint oil. It was observed that the composition of the catmint oil, vis-\u00e0-vis, the relative amounts of trans\u2013cis and cis\u2013trans-nepetalactone isomers, had a major impact on the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. This study also focused on minimizing the formation of a less desirable byproduct, puleganic acid.

Higher pressure enhanced the activity of the catalyst but it did not significantly impact the formation of undesired byproducts, such as puleganic and nepetalic acids. Spiking experiments with suspected catalyst poisons, such as dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide, nepetalic acid, and puleganic acid were also performed to study catalyst deactivation.

Despite this potential, production of protein-based brush-forming polymers is not routinely performed. For the design and production of new protein-based polymers with optimal brush-forming properties, it would be desirable to have a cloning strategy that allows an iterative approach wherein the protein based-polymer product can be produced and evaluated, and then if necessary, it can be sequentially modified in a controlled manner to obtain optimal surface density and brush extension. In this work, we report on the development of a cloning strategy intended for the production of protein-based brush-forming polymers. This strategy is based on the assembly of modules of DNA that encode for blocks of protein-based polymers into a commercially available expression vector; there is no need for custom-modified vectors and no need for intermediate cloning vectors. Additionally, because the design of new protein-based biopolymers can be an iterative process, our method enables sequential modification of a protein-based polymer product. With at least 21 bacterial expression vectors and 11 yeast expression vectors compatible with this strategy, there are a number of options available for production of protein-based polymers. It is our intent that this strategy will aid in advancing the production of protein-based brush-forming polymers.

Native mass spectrometry contributes to untangling quaternary structures by preserving the integrity of protein complexes in the gas phase. Tandem mass spectrometry by collision-induced dissociation (CID) can then be used to release subunits from these intact complexes, thereby providing structural information on the stoichiometry and topology. Cumulatively, such studies have revealed the preferred release of peripheral subunits during CID. In contrast, here we describe and focus on dissociation pathways that release nonperipheral subunits from hetero-complexes in CID at high collision energies. We find that nonperipheral subunits are ejected with a high propensity, as a consequence of sequential dissociation events, upon initial removal of peripheral subunits. Alternatively, nonperipheral subunits can be released directly from a charge-reduced or an elongated intact complex. As demonstrated here for a range of protein assemblies, releasing nonperipheral subunits under controlled conditions may provide unique structural information on the stoichiometry and topology of protein complexes."},{"title":"Organocatalytic Conversion of Nucleosides to Furanoid Glycals","abstract":"A class of organocatalysts that are highly active for the conversion of 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides to furanoid glycals have been discovered.

As expected for surfaces composed of weak acid groups the surface potential and strength of interaction are sensitive to pH and ionic strength. Repulsive forces grow with the degree of ionization. At low fractional ionization, the surfaces experience attractions with a range larger than that expected for van der Waals interactions and the strength of adhesion is large. The strength of adhesion and extent of attractions diminish with increasing pH. As the surface groups ionize, at intermediate pH values, jump-in distances and adhesion grow with ionic strength and at high pH they saturate with increasing electrolyte concentration at values close to those expected for van der Waals interactions. However, the maximum charge is around 5% of the total expected for the surfaces. Thus, allowing sodium ions to bind, with a binding constant of pKNa = 3.7 and pKa = 6.3, ionic strength and pH dependencies of the surface charge can be described.

Aramid nanofibers (ANFs) represent one of the most promising nanoscale building blocks for high-performance nanocomposites. In this work, waterborne polyurethanes (PUs) have been reinforced with ANFs using two solution processing methods, namely, layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique and the vacuum-assisted flocculation (VAF) method. Record-high modulus of 5.275 GPa and ultimate strength of 98.02 MPa are obtained among all the reported PU based nanocomposites. We attribute such achievement to the similar molecular structures of ANFs with PUs which ensures a high affinity made possible by the manifold interfacial interactions. The formation of multiple hydrogen bonds due to the presence of amide groups with appropriate spacing in both components is confirmed by the computer simulation. Compared with the VAF method, it is found that LBL assembly allows a better load transfer, resulting in higher ultimate strength and stiffness. The VAF method shows advantages in improving the ultimate strength at low loadings of ANFs. We believe our work may not only lead to a new practical combination within the field of composite materials but also provide important implications for the future design of nanocomposites based on the innovative nanofillers."},{"title":"The Issue of Morphology and Molecular Accessibility of Swollen Gel-Type Resins:\u2009 An Integrated Inverse Steric Exclusion Chromatography\u2212Electron Spin Resonance\u2212NMR Approach","abstract":"A number of microporous fairly hydrophilic poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-methylenebisacrylamide) (poly(DMAA-MBAA)) resins (cross-linking degree from 2 to 8%) have been examined with techniques that provide information on the structure on the nanometer scale and molecular accessibility of these materials in the swollen state.

Fe(III) ion impregnation of TiO2 with different salts is observed to influence photocatalytic degradation of acetophenone. Fe(III) salt anions were observed to influence the initial rate of degradation. For example, the initial rate of degradation of acetophenone decreases with an increase in percentage of Fe(III) ions in the case of the catalysts prepared using ferric nitrate and ferric chloride salts. However, the initial rate of degradation was observed to increase with ferric sulfate impregnated catalysts. The final percentage degradation of acetophenone was found to increase continuously with an increase in Fe(III) ion concentration, irrespective of the anion. These observations have been discussed in terms of influence of the presence of Fe(III) ions on the recombination of the electron and holes generated during UV irradiation of TiO2.

Typically, the standard primitive approximation (PA) is employed in enzymatic PI simulations. Nonetheless, these PI simulations are computationally demanding due to the large number of discretizations, or beads, required to obtain converged results. The efficiency of PI simulations may be greatly improved if higher order factorizations of the density matrix operator are employed. Herein, we compare the results of model calculations obtained employing the standard PA, the improved operator of Takahashi and Imada (TI), and several gradient-based forward corrector algorithms due to Chin (CH). The quantum partition function is computed for the harmonic oscillator, Morse, symmetric, and asymmetric double well potentials. These potentials are simple models for nuclear quantum effects, such as zero-point energy and tunneling. It is shown that a unique set of CH parameters may be employed for a variety of systems. Additionally, the nuclear QM effects of a water molecule, treated with density functional theory, are computed. Finally, we derive a practical perturbation expression for efficient computation of isotope effects in chemical systems using the staging algorithm. This new isotope effect approach is tested in conjunction with the PA, TI, and CH methods to compute the equilibrium isotope effect in the Schiff base-oxyanion keto\u2212enol tautomerism in the cofactor pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate in the enzyme alanine racemase.

Results of a Pilot Experiment To Evaluate Organic and Conventional Foods","abstract":"There is evidence that organic food often contains relatively high amounts of natural toxic compounds produced by fungi or plants, whereas corresponding conventional food tends to contain more synthetic toxins such as pesticide residues, but only a few studies have evaluated the impact of their consumption on health. This study proposes a novel approach to evaluate the potential health risk of organic compared to conventional food consumption, that is, the assay of sensitive markers of cell function in vulnerable conditions. The markers utilized were intestinal and splenic lymphocyte proliferative capacity and liver acute-phase reaction, both responding to the presence of toxins. The vulnerable conditions in which body defenses can be less efficient were weaning and protein-energy malnutrition. This study reports the results of a pilot experiment on one sample of eight varieties of organically and conventionally grown wheat. Weaned rats were assigned to two groups fed conventional (CV) or organic (ORG) wheat for 30 days. Each group was divided in two subgroups of well-nourished (WN) or protein-energy-malnourished (PEM) rats. For each rat, the lymphocyte proliferation was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation after stimulation of cells with a mitogen, in a culture medium containing either commercial fetal calf serum (FCS) or the corresponding rat serum (RS) to mimic the in vivo proliferative response. The acute-phase proteins (albumin, transthyretin, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, retinol-binding protein) were measured in plasma by Western blotting and immunostaining with specific antibodies. The proliferative response of lymphocytes cultured with FCS and the amount of acute-phase proteins of rats fed the ORG wheat sample, either WN or PEM, did not differ from those of rats fed the CV wheat sample. However, the proliferative response of lymphocytes cultured with RS was inhibited in PEM-CV compared with PEM-ORG. The content of mycotoxins was highest in the organic sample, and therefore the immunotoxic effect was probably due to other contaminants in the CV wheat. In conclusion, these results indicate that the conventional wheat sample tested represented a higher risk for lymphocyte function than the wheat sample organically grown, at least in vulnerable conditions.

Thus, mutations might influence differently the binding kinetics of peptidomimetic ligands and of the natural substrate."},{"title":"Iron Plaque: A Barrier Layer to the Uptake and Translocation of Copper Oxide Nanoparticles by Rice Plants","abstract":"The waterlogging environment generally results in the deposition of iron plaque on plant roots, which may impact the fate of metal-based nanoparticles. Here, we investigated the influence of iron plaque on the uptake, translocation, and transformation of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) in rice plants. The results show that the presence of iron plaque dramatically reduced the Cu contents in roots and shoots by 89% and 78% of those without iron plaque under 100 mg\/L CuO NP treatment. Meanwhile, the Cu accumulation in plants was negatively related to the amount of iron plaque. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis demonstrated lower percentage of CuO but higher proportion of Cu(I) in shoots exposed to CuO NPs with the formation of iron plaque. Furthermore, micro X-ray fluorescence (\u03bc-XRF) combined with \u03bc-XANES revealed that the iron plaque in the root epidermis and exodermis consisted of goethite and ferrihydrite, which hindered the uptake of CuO NPs by roots. However, a few CuO NPs were still absorbed by roots via root hairs or lateral roots, and further translocated to shoots. But eventually, more than 90% of total Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I)-cysteine and Cu2O in leaf veins of rice plants with iron plaque."},{"title":"Stereochemical Assignment of C-24 and C-25 of Amarasterone A, a\u00a0Putative Biosynthetic Intermediate of Cyasterone","abstract":"A C29 phytoecdysteroid named amarasterone A (1) has been isolated from Cyathula capitata (Amaranthaceae), Leuzea carthamoides (Asteraceae), and Microsorum scolopendria (Polypodiaceae). We recently isolated amarasterone A from C. officinalis. Amarasterone A has been postulated as a biosynthetic intermediate of cyasterone in Cyathula sp. The stereochemistry at the C-24 and C-25 positions of these amarasterone A samples was investigated by comparing the NMR spectroscopic data with those of stereodefined model compounds, (24R,25S)-, (24R,25R)-, (24S,25S)-, and (24S,25R)-isomers of (20R,22R)-3\u03b2-methoxystigmast-5-ene-20,22,26-triol (2a\u2013d), which were synthesized in the present study. Amarasterone A isolated from Cyathula officinalis was determined to be the (24R,25S)-isomer (1a), while amarasterone A from L. carthamoides was found to be the (24R,25R)-isomer (1b).

Interestingly, compounds 1a,b can be prepared from a [W7O24]6\u2013 aqueous solution, [(n-C4H9)4N]4[W10O32], or Na10[H2W12O42], but when [H2W12O40]6\u2013 aqueous solution was the starting material, the achiral compound [CuL1]2[H4W12O40]\u00b75H2O (2) was obtained. When a terpyridine ligand (L2) having a coordination mode similar to that of L1 was used, the mesomeric dimer [Cu3(L2)3(H2O)(H2W12O40)]2\u00b74H2O (3) was obtained from [W7O24]6\u2013 aqueous solution or Na10[H2W12O42], but from [H2W12O40]6\u2013 aqueous solution only compound [Cu2(L2)2Cl2]2[W10O32] (4) was isolated. It is notable that in compounds 1a,b and 3 the symmetry of the \u03b1-[H2W12O40]6\u2013 cluster is broken by asymmetric coordination with metal\u2013organic units in a similar mode. As the asymmetric subunit based on a tridecorated [H2W12O40]6\u2013 cluster can be obtained from several isopolyoxotungstate sources except for [H2W12O40]6\u2013, we speculate that the symmetry breaking of \u03b1-[H2W12O40]6\u2013 depends on the transformation of isopolyoxotungstates.

The major health-promoting effect of cell walls occurs when they reach the colon and are fermented by the gut microbiota. In this study, the fermentation kinetics of carrot cell wall particle dispersions with different particle size and microstructure were investigated in vitro using porcine feces. The cumulative gas production and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced were measured at time intervals up to 48 h. The results show that larger cell clusters with an average particle size (d0.5) of 298 and 137 \u03bcm were more rapidly fermented and produced more SCFAs and gas than smaller single cells (75 \u03bcm) or cell fragments (50 \u03bcm), particularly between 8 and 20 h. Confocal microscopy suggests that the junctions between cells provides an environment that promotes bacterial growth, outweighing the greater specific surface area of smaller particles as a driver for more rapid fermentation. The study demonstrates that it may be possible, by controlling the size of cell wall particles, to design plant-based foods for fiber delivery and promotion of colon fermentation to maximize the potential for human health."},{"title":"Mechanisms and Energy Transfer for Surface Generation of NH<sub>2<\/sub> during NH<sub>3<\/sub> Plasma Processing of Metal and Polymer Substrates","abstract":"The interactions of NH2 radicals with different substrate materials during NH3 plasma processing were investigated using the imaging of radicals interacting with surfaces (IRIS) technique. NH2 scatter coefficients, S, were obtained as a function of applied rf power for polyimide, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), platinum, copper, and silicon substrates. For most experimental conditions, S \u2265 1, indicating that NH2 surface generation occurs at the plasma-substrate interface. Information on energy transfer between NH2 and the different substrates during processing was gleaned from measurements of the translational temperature for scattered NH2 molecules, \u03d1Tsc, as a function of applied rf powers. NH2 radicals scattered from Pt, Cu, and Si substrates have very little dependence of \u03d1Tsc on rf power, whereas the two polymeric materials demonstrate a nearly linear increase in \u03d1Tsc with applied rf power. The change was most dramatic for polyimide substrates, where \u03d1Tsc increased by \u223c120 K between 50 and 150 W. Scattering coefficients and \u03d1Tsc values measured using a molecular beam without ions indicate that charged species serve to increase both the kinetic energy and the amount of scattered NH2 radicals. Mechanistic implications for NH3 plasma processing are drawn from both the scatter coefficient results and the energy transfer data.

Previously, a limited number of inhibitors have shown efficacy in combating such bacterial drug resistance. However, many Gram-negative pathogens have evolved inhibitor resistant forms of these hydrolytic enzymes. A single point mutation of the active site residue Ser130 to a Gly in either TEM or SHV results in resistance to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, an important clinical \u03b2-lactam\u2212\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic. Previous structural and modeling studies of the S130G mutants of TEM and SHV have shown differences in how these two distinct but closely related enzymes compensate for the loss of the Ser130 residue. In the case of S130G SHV, a structure of tazobactam in the active site has suggested that the inhibitor preferentially assumes a cis-enamine intermediate form when the Ser130 hydroxyl is absent. Raman crystallographic studies of S130G SHV inhibited with tazobactam, sulbactam, clavulanic acid, and 2\u2018-glutaroxy penem sulfone (SA2-13) were performed with the aim of identifying the type and amount of intermediate formed with each drug to understand the role of the S130G mutation in formation of the important enamine intermediates. It is demonstrated that with the exception of sulbactam, each compound forms observable trans-enamine intermediates. For S130G reacted with tazobactam, identical steady state levels of enamine are achieved when compared to those of wild-type (WT) or even deacylation deficient forms of the enzyme. With clavulanic acid, slightly smaller amounts of enamine are observed within the first 30 min of the reaction but are not significantly different than those for tazobactam. Thus, the resistance mutation does not substantially affect the amount of trans-enamine formed with clavulanic acid during the critical early time period of inhibition. This finding has important implications in the design of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors for drug resistant variants like S130G SHV.

Antiproliferative activity of the compounds also was tested in murine L1210 cells and three human tumor cell lines. All compounds were either less active than TCN and TCN-P or inactive at the highest concentration tested (100 \u03bcM) in both antiviral and antiproliferative assays. Reverse-phase HPLC of extracts from uninfected cells treated with the deoxytriciribine analogues only detected the conversion of 3\u2018-dTCN and 2\u2018,3\u2018-ddTCN to their respective monophosphates. Therefore, either the deoxytriciribine analogues were not transported across the cell membrane or, more likely, they were not substrates for a nucleoside kinase or phosphotransferase. We have concluded that the hydroxyl groups on the ribosyl ring system of TCN and TCN-P must be intact in order to obtain significant antiviral and antineoplastic activity.

The chiral phase used is made of cellulose tribenzoate coated on porous silica. The AEDs were determined using the expectation maximization method, a numerical method that uses directly the raw experimental isotherm data, inverts this set of data into an AED, and introduces no arbitrary information in the calculation. However, it uses the Langmuir equation as the local isotherm. The experimental data fit very well to the bi-Langmuir isotherm model for the more retained enantiomer. Our results show that the AEDs of these two enantiomers have no energy modes that would be identical (same mean energy, mode profile, and mode area), in contrast to numerous cases previously studied, e.g., that of the \u03b2-blockers on a Cel7A column.

Although this system has been reported to be entirely miscible, the DSC results revealed that the glass transition temperatures of the blends were not composition-dependent in the whole composition range. Furthermore, these transitions were quite broad or even double in the blends with high CP content. These features are the result of differing molecular motions attributed to the difference in chemical structure between the two components of the blend. The feasible maximum draw ratio decreased with increasing CP content due to restraint of chain slippage and necking caused by the stiffness and high friction coefficient of the CP component. A remarkable feature during uniaxial drawing was that the manner of crystallization of the PHB component under strain varied from the c-axis-oriented to the a-axis-oriented crystal growth with increasing CP content. WAXD analysis demonstrated that drawn pure PHB exhibited an ordinary c-axis-oriented pattern, indicating that the (110) and (020) main reflections of PHB were concentrated on the equatorial line. On the contrary, when the CP content was 50 wt %, the diffraction texture was transformed to the a-axis orientation where the (110) reflection was located near the meridian and the (020) and (002) reflections lay on the equatorial line. In the SAXS patterns of the blends containing 30\u221250 wt % CP, instead of meridional spots, the equatorial streaks were clearly observed, providing direct evidence for lamellar stacking perpendicular to the stretching direction. Such a change of crystalline orientation was found to be strongly dependent on the draw ratio and annealing temperature in addition to the blend composition. In the present paper, a mechanism based on the intramolecular nucleation and confined crystal growth model was suggested to interpret this uncommon orientation behavior.

The purpose of the study was to gain insight into the effect of biostimulation on the microbial community. Biostimulation with acetate led to the onset of RDX reduction at the site, which was most apparent in monitoring well MW309.

Community DNA from MW309 was analyzed with 454 pyrosequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Production of RDX metabolites corresponded to a microbial community shift from primarily Fe(III)-reducing Betaproteobacteria to a community dominated by Fe(III)-reducing Deltaproteobacteria (Geobacteraceae in particular) and Bacteroidetes taxa.

In this study, we report that the detrimental effect due to the CO2 interaction with perovskite oxide can be turned into a beneficial effect for facilitating ORR through tailoring the material composition of the perovskite. More specifically, for cobalt-free SrSc0.025Nb0.075Fe0.9O3\u2212\u03b4 (SSNF), the exposure to the CO2 atmosphere results in the formation of a minor amount of surface strontium carbonate mainly in the form of a nanofilm over the perovskite surface, which protects the electrode from further corrosion by CO2, thus achieving a relatively stable performance even under a 10% CO2-containing air atmosphere. When CO2-free air is restored, the SrCO3 is successfully decomposed at intermediate temperatures. As a result, the surface reaction kinetics is recovered to the initial degree while the charge transfer process is obviously improved. An area-specific resistance of only 0.07 \u03a9 cm2 is achieved at 650 \u00b0C after the CO2-induced surface activation, much smaller than the original value of 0.13 \u03a9 cm2. In addition, the CO2-treated electrode shows a fairly stable performance for ORR under a subsequent CO2-free air atmosphere. To create such a beneficial effect, it is critical to tailor the degree of interaction of the perovskite surface with CO2, while the benchmark Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 (BSCF) shows a too strong interaction with CO2 with the formation of bulk-phase-like carbonate, which failed to decomposed even when restored with a CO2-free atmosphere at intermediate temperatures, and as a result, worsened the ORR activity after the CO2 treatment."},{"title":"Phase Transfer of Rhodium(II)-Based Metal\u2013Organic Polyhedra Bearing Coordinatively Bound Cargo Enables Molecular Separation","abstract":"The transfer of nanoparticles between immiscible phases can be driven by externally triggered changes in their surface composition.

As proof-of-concept that our phase-transfer approach could be used in chemical separation, we employed Rh(II)-based MOPs to separate a challenging mixture of structurally similar cyclic aliphatic (tetrahydrothiophene) and aromatic (thiophene) compounds.

The PPDA-CnBZ polymer molecules were found to undergo mainly photodimerization upon UV light irradiation. However, the occurrence of trans\u2212cis photoisomerization in the PPDA-CnBZ film could not be detected. In addition, irradiation with linearly polarized UV light (LPUVL) induced selective photoreaction of the PDA chromophores positioned parallel to the polarization direction of the LPUVL, which caused the molecular reorientation of the polymer chains. In the irradiated films the unreacted PDA chromophores were found to anisotropically distribute in a direction perpendicular to the polarization direction of the LPUVL, whereas the photodimerized PDA units displayed nearly isotropic distribution in the film plane. Thus, the LC alignment on irradiated PPDA-CnBZ films can be deduced from the relationship between the distributions of polymer chains and of liquid crystal (LC) molecules. In particular, the unreacted PDA chromophores remained at the film surface irradiated with LPUVL favorably align the LC molecules along their reorientation direction, which is perpendicular to the polarization direction of the LPUVL via their anisotropic interactions with the LC molecules.

Incineration, the most widely used process for solvent disposal, is not a green method because of the release of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases to the environment. A systematic framework for solvent recovery has been developed to overcome the drawbacks of the existing disposal methods. This framework uses a superstructure-based approach that considers the simultaneous comparison of multiple separation technologies for solvent recovery. The viability of this framework was tested using two representative case studies of varying complexities.

Despite this reaction being part of numerous studies, a combined understanding of the product and fluorescence yields is still lacking. Here, the rotational and vibrational distributions of OH(A) are determined from dispersed fluorescence following photoexcitation of both room-temperature and jet-cooled water vapor, for the first time in the same experiment. This work compares new data of state-resolved fluorescence with literature molecular branching ratios and brings previous studies into agreement through careful consideration of OH(A) fluorescent and predissociation lifetimes and confirms a fluorescent quantum yield of 8%. Comparison of the room-temperature and jet-cooled OH(A) populations indicate the temperature of H2O prior to excitation has subtle effects on the OH(A) population distribution, such as altering the rotational distribution in the \u03bd\u2032 = 0 population and affecting the population in the \u03bd\u2032 = 1 state. These results indicate jet-cooled water vapor may have a 1% higher fluorescence quantum yield compared to room-temperature water vapor."},{"title":"Bimetallic Coordination Polymers via Combination of Substitution-Inert Building Blocks and Labile Connectors","abstract":"A rational approach to the synthesis of silver\u2212chromium mixed-metal coordination polymers is presented: 3-cyanoacetylacetone (HacacCN) features two potential binding sites. After deprotonation, it has been used as a chelating dionato ligand in the pseudo octahedral complex Cr(acacCN)3; two polymorphs of this compound have been identified. In its protonated form, HacacCN was employed as a N donor toward Ag(I). Both functionalities may be exploited within the same solid: The chromium complex and silver salts of weakly coordinating anions have been successfully combined to mixed-metal coordination polymers. Cr(acacCN)3 plays the role of a substitution-inert tecton with predictable bonding geometry which interacts with the conformationally soft silver cations via two or all three of its peripheric nitrile groups. From an equimolar amount of both constituents, six solids featuring a 1:1 ratio between Cr- and Ag-derived building blocks were obtained in good yield; their structures depend on the counteranions and the cocrystallized solvent and correspond either to 2D networks with (6,3) or augmented (4,4) topology or, in one case, adopt a 3D connectivity. In addition, three products with a Cr\/Ag = 2:1 stoichiometry have been isolated: they adopt two-dimensional network structures."},{"title":"Flavonoids, Flavonoid Metabolites, and Phenolic Acids Inhibit Oxidative Stress in the Neuronal Cell Line HT-22 Monitored by ECIS and MTT Assay: A Comparative Study","abstract":"A real-time and label-free in vitro assay based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was established, validated, and compared to an end-point MTT assay within an experimental trial addressing the cytoprotective effects of 19 different flavonoids, flavonoid metabolites, and phenolic acids and their methyl esters on the HT-22 neuronal cell line, after induction of oxidative stress with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Among the flavonoids under study, only those with a catechol unit and an additional 4-keto group provided cytoprotection. The presence of a 2,3-double bond was not a structural prerequisite for a neuroprotective effect. In the case of the phenolics, catechol substitution was the only structural requirement for activity. The flavonoids and other phenolics with a ferulic acid substitution or a single hydroxy group showed no activity. Electrochemical characterization of all compounds via square-wave voltammetry provided a rather specific correlation between cytoprotective activity and redox potential for the active flavonoids, but not for the active phenolics with a low molecular weight. Moreover this study was used to compare label-free ECIS recordings with results of the established MTT assay. Whereas the former provides time-resolved and thus entirely unbiased information on changes of cell morphology that are unequivocally associated with cell death, the latter requires predefined exposure times and a strict causality between metabolic activity and cell death. However, MTT assays are based on standard lab equipment and provide a more economic way to higher throughput."},{"title":"Include Dispersion in Quantum Chemical Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions: The Case of Isoaspartyl Dipeptidase","abstract":"The lack of dispersion in the B3LYP functional has been proposed to be the main origin of big errors in quantum chemical modeling of a few enzymes and transition metal complexes. In this work, the essential dispersion effects that affect quantum chemical modeling are investigated. With binuclear zinc isoaspartyl dipeptidase (IAD) as an example, dispersion is included in the modeling of enzymatic reactions by two different procedures, i.e., (i) geometry optimizations followed by single-point calculations of dispersion (approach I) and (ii) the inclusion of dispersion throughout geometry optimization and energy evaluation (approach II). Based on a 169-atom chemical model, the calculations show a qualitative consistency between approaches I and II in energetics and most key geometries, demonstrating that both approaches are available with the latter preferential since both geometry and energy are dispersion-corrected in approach II. When a smaller model without Arg233 (147 atoms) was used, an inconsistency was observed, indicating that the missing dispersion interactions are essentially responsible for determining equilibrium geometries. Other technical issues and mechanistic characteristics of IAD are also discussed, in particular with respect to the effects of Arg233."},{"title":"Conformational Changes in Serum Pectins during Industrial Tomato Paste Production","abstract":"It is well-known that an irreversible decrease in serum viscosity occurs when tomato juice is concentrated by evaporation into paste. Several studies have suggested that the loss in serum viscosity is due to pectin depolymerization, caused by the high temperatures used during industrial tomato paste production. This study demonstrates that conformational changes in pectin may play a more important role than pectin depolymerization in the irreversible loss of serum viscosity during industrial tomato paste production. Samples of tomato juice, processing intermediates, and paste were obtained from a commercial producer in California. After dilution to 5 \u00b0Brix, tomato serum was obtained by centrifugation at 15000g for 10 min. Weight average molecular weight (Mw) and root-mean-square (rms) radius of the polymers in the tomato serum were determined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering and refractive index detectors (HPSEC\u2212MALLS\u2212RI). Serum viscosity decreased throughout the juice concentration process, especially at later stages, where the processing temperature reached a maximum of 90\u221295 \u00b0C. In parallel with this decrease in serum viscosity, there was an increase in the soluble pectin concentration. Analysis of the Mw distribution of the tomato serum showed that solubilization of pectin occurred across the entire polymer distribution range. The Mw changed from 2.62 \u00d7 105 g\/mol in the juice to 2.61 \u00d7 105 g\/mol in the paste, indicating that minimal depolymerization occurred. However, the rms radius distribution indicated that the pectin conformation became more compact as the juice became more concentrated. Conformational plots revealed that serum pectins in the hot-break tomato juice and at the early stages of concentration behaved as extended coils, having shape factors of about 0.40. In processing intermediates taken from later stages in the process and in the paste, the shape factor changed to about 0.25, indicating a more compact conformation. This conformational change correlated with the observed decrease in serum viscosity in the paste production process. This result is consistent with a Flory\u2212Fox-type relationship between viscosity, rms radius, and Mw. The conformational change may be due to increased polymer\u2212polymer interaction brought about by the concentration process."},{"title":"Temperature Sensitization of Liposomes Using Copolymers of <i>N<\/i>-Isopropylacrylamide","abstract":"To obtain liposomes which release the contents in response to ambient temperature, liposomes modified with copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide with varying lower critical solution temperatures have been designed. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide)s with various compositions were synthesized by free-radical copolymerization. The lower critical solution temperature of the polymer increased with increasing acrylamide content in the polymer. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide-co-N,N-didodecylacrylamide)s were also prepared via the same method as the thermosensitive polymers having anchor groups to the liposome membrane. Calcein-loaded dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine\/egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (6:4, w\/w) liposomes were coated with these polymers by incubating the liposomes with aqueous solutions of the polymers. The liposomes hardly released the contents below the lower critical solution temperature of the polymer, but the release was greatly enhanced above that temperature. The liposomes were also made from a mixture of the same lipids and the polymer. The liposome revealed a more drastic release property than the liposomes prepared by the incubation with the polymer solution, because the polymer chains were bound on both surfaces of the membrane. The close relationship between lower critical solution temperatures of the polymers and temperature regions where enhancement of the release from the polymer-fixed liposomes demonstrates that the release was triggered by alteration of the polymers from a hydrophilic state to a hydrophobic state occurring at their lower critical solution temperatures.

Their protein and lipid composition are a consequence of sorting events at the level of the multivesicular body, a central organelle which integrates endocytic and secretory pathways. Characterization of exosomes from different biological samples has shown the presence of common as well as cell-type specific proteins. Remarkably, the protein content of the exosomes is modified upon pathological or stress conditions. Hepatocytes play a central role in the body response to stress metabolizing potentially harmful endogenous substances as well as xenobiotics. In the present study, we described and characterized for the first time exosome secretion in nontumoral hepatocytes, and with the use of a systematic proteomic approach, we establish the first extensive proteome of a hepatocyte-derived exosome population which should be useful in furthering our understanding of the hepatic function and in the identification of components that may serve as biomarkers for hepatic alterations. Our analysis identifies a significant number of proteins previously described among exosomes derived from others cell types as well as proteins involved in metabolizing lipoproteins, endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, not previously described in exosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exosomal membrane proteins can constitute an interesting tool to express nonexosomal proteins into exosomes with therapeutic purposes."},{"title":"DNA-Mediated Size-Selective Nanoparticle Assembly for Multiplexed Surface Encoding","abstract":"Multiplexed surface encoding is achieved by positioning two different sizes of gold nanocubes on gold surfaces with precisely defined locations for each particle via template-confined, DNA-mediated nanoparticle assembly.

The releasing mechanisms of these drugs were investigated in detail. Rapid release of heparin can achieve anticoagulation and endothelialization, whereas slow release of rapamycin can realize antiproliferative therapy for long term. In vitro hemocompatibility and promotion for proliferation of vein endothelial cells and the inhibition of smooth muscle cells were conducted. In vivo stent implantation results verify that the mesoporous silica coating with both heparin and rapamycin can successfully accelerate the endothelialization process and realize the antiproliferative therapy for as long as 3 months. These results indicate that this multifunctional mesoporous coating containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs might be a promising stent coating in the future."},{"title":"Direct Observation of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> during Alcohol Oxidation by O<sub>2<\/sub> in Supercritical Water","abstract":"This paper presents the direct quantitative measurement of the presence of hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate produced during the oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol by oxygen in supercritical water.

While the mechanisms for the conductivity modulation are quite different and include metal\u2013insulator phase transition and surface charge writing, generally it is implied that this effect is a result of electrical modification of the LaAlO3 surface (either due to electrochemical dissociation of surface adsorbates or free charge deposition) leading to the change in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density at the LaAlO3\/SrTiO3 (LAO\/STO) interface. In this paper, using piezoresponse force microscopy we demonstrate a switchable electromechanical response of the LAO overlayer, which we attribute to the motion of oxygen vacancies through the LAO layer thickness.

Maximum immunostimulation was achieved with CpG content as low as 5% (with total oligonucleotide surface coverage remaining constant), correlating to high levels of antitumor cytokine release and low levels of cancer-promoting ones.

Yet, after a decade since its inception, actual mechanisms of anion\u2212\u03c0 interactions remain highly debated. To elicit a complete and accurate understanding of how different anions interact with \u03c0-electron-deficient 1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimides (NDIs) under different conditions, we have extensively studied these interactions using powerful experimental techniques. Herein, we demonstrate that, depending on the electron-donating abilities (Lewis basicity) of anions and electron-accepting abilities (\u03c0-acidity) of NDIs, modes of anion\u2013NDI interactions vary from extremely weak non-chromogenic anion\u2212\u03c0 interactions to chromogenic anion-induced charge-transfer (CT) and electron-transfer (ET) phenomena. In aprotic solvents, electron-donating abilities of anions generally follow their Lewis basicity order, whereas \u03c0-acidity of NDIs can be fine-tuned by installing different electron-rich and electron-deficient substituents. While strongly Lewis basic anions (OH\u2013 and F\u2013) undergo thermal ET with most NDIs, generating NDI\u2022\u2013 radical anions and NDI2\u2013 dianions in aprotic solvents, weaker Lewis bases (AcO\u2013, H2PO4\u2013, Cl\u2013, etc.) often require the photoexcitation of moderately \u03c0-acidic NDIs to generate the corresponding NDI\u2022\u2013 radical anions via photoinduced ET (PET).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the compound's ground state indicate that occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) localized on carboxylate groups of the bipyridyl ligands (through which the compound binds to the TiO2 nanoparticles) energetically match the semiconductor valence band; the lowest unoccupied MOs lie above the conduction band edge and are bipyridine \u03c0* in character. These results suggest that the compound is well-positioned to bind strongly to TiO2 and engage in electron transfer from excited states associated with the bipyridyl groups. Various excited states of the chromophore were identified using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The TD-DFT calculations predict with significant accuracy excitation energies and corresponding oscillator strengths of transitions observed in the experimental electronic absorption spectrum in ethanol solution. Some of the calculated singlet excited states show significant electronic localization on the bipyridyl groups which, in conjunction with their energies and relatively large oscillator strengths, suggests that these states can be involved in efficient excited-state formation and subsequent electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Considering both oscillator strength and spatial proximity, the most efficient electronic injection is expected at excitation energies of approximately 2.3, 3.0, and 3.2 eV.

The energies of these metastable species are often predicted using empirical correlation methods because ab initio predictions are computationally very expensive. Empirical correlation methods can be justified in the framework of Weisskopf\u2013Fano\u2013Feshbach theory but tend to work well only within closely related families of molecules or within a restricted energy range. The reason for this behavior can be understood using an alternative theoretical justification in the framework of the Hazi\u2013Taylor stabilization method, which suggests that the empirical parameters do not so much correct for the coupling of the computed state to the continuum but for electron correlation effects and that therefore empirical correlation methods can be improved by using more accurate electronic structure methods to compute the energy of the confined electron. This idea is tested by choosing a heterogeneous reference set of temporary states and comparing empirical correlation schemes based on Hartree\u2013Fock orbital energies, Kohn\u2013Sham orbital energies, and attachment energies computed with the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method. The results show that using more reliable energies for the confined electron indeed enhances the predictive power of empirical correlation schemes and that useful correlations can be established beyond closely related families of molecules. Certain types of \u03c3* states are still problematic, and the reasons for this behavior are analyzed. On the other hand, preliminary results suggest that the new scheme can even be useful for predicting energies of bound anions at a fraction of the computational cost of reliable ab initio calculations.

For surface-adsorbed \u03c0 bowls, however, only conformations with the bowl opening pointing away from the surface have been observed so far. Here we show for sumanene on Ag(111) that both bowl-up and bowl-down conformations can be stabilized. Analysis of the molecular layer as a function of coverage reveals an unprecedented structural phase transition involving a bowl inversion of one-third of the molecules. On the basis of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and complementary atomistic simulations, we develop a model that describes the observed phase transition in terms of a subtle interplay between inversion-dependent adsorption energies and intermolecular interactions. In addition, we explore the coexisting bowl-up and -down conformations with respect to host\u2013guest binding of methane. STM reveals a clear energetic preference for methane binding to the concave face of sumanene."},{"title":"Oil Phase Evaporation-Induced Self-Assembly of Hydrophobic Nanoparticles into Spherical Clusters with Controlled Surface Chemistry in an Oil-in-Water Dispersion and Comparison of Behaviors of Individual and Clustered Iron Oxide Nanoparticles","abstract":"We report a general method for preparing nanoparticle clusters (NPCs) in an oil-in-water emulsion system mediated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), where previously only individual nanoparticles were obtained. NPCs of magnetic, metallic, and semiconductor nanoparticles have been prepared to demonstrate the generality of the method. The NPCs were spherical and composed of densely packed individual nanoparticles. The number density of nanoparticles in the oil phase was found to be critical for the formation, morphology, and yield of NPCs. The method developed here is scalable and can produce NPCs in nearly 100% yield at a concentration of 5 mg\/mL in water, which is approximately 5 times higher than the highest value reported in the literature. The surface chemistry of NPCs can also be controlled by replacing CTAB with polymers containing different functional groups via a similar procedure. The reproducible production of NPCs with well-defined shapes has allowed us to compare the properties of individual and clustered iron oxide nanoparticles, including magnetization, magnetic moments, and contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found that, due to their collective properties, NPCs are more responsive to an external magnetic field and can potentially serve as better contrast enhancement agents than individually dispersed magnetic NPs in MRI."},{"title":"Radiationless Transitions between the First Excited Triplet State and the Singlet Ground State in Ethylene:\u2009 A Theoretical Study","abstract":"A theoretical analysis is reported for the first triplet (T) to ground state (N) radiationless transition of the ethylene molecule. This work is based on ab initio calculations of the potential energy surfaces for the T and N states taking into account CC and CH bond stretching as well as HCH bending and torsion of the CH2 groups. The radiationless transition rates are calculated for different molecular vibrational levels using the Fermi\u2212Wentzel golden rule formalism. The interaction matrix element \u3008T|Vint|N\u3009 is approximated by the electronic spin\u2212orbit coupling matrix element between the N and T states, integrated over the torsional coordinate; the effect of the three totally symmetric normal modes on the calculated rates is accounted for by their Franck\u2212Condon factors. The transition rates calculated in this work are on the order of 106\u2212108 s-1 if one or two levels of the totally symmetric modes are excited, which is in good agreement with the global values predicted earlier by Salem and Rowland.

Examples include gel electrophoresis and the self-interaction of DNA within cells and viral capsids. Here we study the interaction of multiple DNA molecules within a nanopore by tethering the DNA to a bead held in a laser optical trap to produce a \u201cmolecular tug-of-war\u201d. We measure this tether force as a function of the number of DNA molecules in the pore and show that the force per molecule decreases with the number of molecules. A simple scaling argument based on a mean field theory of the hydrodynamic interactions between multiple DNA strands explains our observations. At high salt concentrations, when the Debye length approaches the size of the counterions, the force per molecule becomes essentially independent of the number of molecules. We attribute this to a sharp decrease in electroosmotic flow which makes the hydrodynamic interactions ineffective."},{"title":"Di(methylimidazole)prolinol Silyl Ether Catalyzed Highly Michael Addition of Aldehydes to Nitroolefins in Water","abstract":"  A new pyrrolidine-based organocatalyst for asymmetric reactions has been developed and shown to be a very effective catalyst for the Michael reaction involving various nitroolefins and aldehydes in water.

By recruiting an ubiquitin ligase to a target protein, PROTACs promote ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the target protein. The generation of effective PROTACs depends on the nature of the protein\/ligase ligand pair, linkage site, linker length, and linker composition, all of which have been difficult to address in a systematic way. Herein, we describe a \u201cclick chemistry\u201d approach for the synthesis of PROTACs.

Tiny crystals of PB and a suitable template are necessary for generating large pore diameter and large pore volume. In this reactor, the tiny crystals could be obtained by increasing the mass transfer rate between the gas phase and the liquid phase through dispersing the CO2 gas into many microbubbles, and these microbubbles could act as a template to increase the pore volume. The effects of the final pH of the aqueous solution, the concentrations of raw materials, and the flow rate of the gas phase on pore properties of products were investigated. The results showed that when the final pH of the aqueous solution was between 10.5 and 9.4, pure PB could be obtained, and the crystal size of PB was about 2.3 nm. In addition, the specific surface area, the pore volume, and the average pore diameter of PB reached 548.5 m2\/g, 2.22 mL\/g, and 16.2 nm, respectively, under optimal conditions; these values were much higher than those prepared in the stirred tank.

This discovery offers an alternative mechanism for isonitrile formation. The other isonitrile synthases, such as IsnA, XnPvcA, or AmbI1\/AmbI2, convert R\u2013CH(\u2212NH2)\u2013CO2\u2013 to R\u2013CH(\u2212N\u2261C)\u2013CO2\u2013 by introducing an additional carbon unit; however, ScoE catalyzes the conversion of R\u2013NH\u2013CH2\u2013CO2\u2013 to R\u2013N\u2261C through oxidative decarboxylation. To explore the catalytic mechanism of ScoE, on the basis of the high-resolution crystal structure, the enzyme\u2013substrate complex models were constructed and a series of combined QM\/MM calculations were performed. Our results reveal that the ScoE-catalyzed reaction contains two decoupled parts, desaturation and decarboxylation. The FeIV-oxo-triggered desaturation includes two consecutive H-abstractions, which are similar to the C\u2013C single bond desaturation catalyzed by other nonheme iron\/\u03b1-KG-dependent desaturases. In the second stage reaction, the decarboxylation of the substrate radical generated by H-abstraction was calculated to be quite easy, whereas the previously proposed decarboxylation that involves the hydroxylated intermediate was calculated to be difficult. Importantly, the electron transfer from the substrate to the iron center is the key factor for lowering the barrier of decarboxylation. Thus, the central iron ion is not only responsible for H-abstraction but also acts as an electron relay station for decarboxylation. In addition, this electron transfer was found to be coupled with a proton transfer, in which R310 and the associated H-bonding network play a critical role. In general, the first C\u2013N desaturation is the rate-limiting step of the whole catalysis with an overall energy barrier of 17.6 or 16.9 kcal\/mol in two competitive pathways, qualitatively agreeing with the estimated free energy (17.9\u201318.1 kcal\/mol) from experiments. These results may provide useful information for understanding the biosynthesis of isonitrile and the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by nonheme iron\/\u03b1-KG-dependent enzymes."},{"title":"Experiments and Kinetic Modeling for CO<sub>2<\/sub> Gasification of Indian Coal Chars in the Context of Underground Coal Gasification","abstract":"Gasification of four Indian coals is carried out in a CO2 atmosphere, using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to determine the intrinsic kinetics over a temperature range of 800\u20131050 \u00b0C with different partial pressures of CO2. The applicability of three models, viz., the volumetric reaction model, the shrinking core model and the random pore model, is evaluated. Of these three models, the random pore model is found to be the most suitable for all the coals considered in the current study. The dependence of the reaction rate on the gas-phase partial pressures is explained by the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model, and the parameters for the inhibition due to CO and CO2 are determined by performing experiments at different partial pressures. In underground coal gasification, the reaction takes place on reasonably large sized coal particles, wherein diffusion effects are significant.

Despite the absence of solvent, Pd catalyst on all three supports yields to a quantitative conversion of pinene to pinanes and a higher selectivity for the cis isomer (72\u201389%). The temperature affected similarly the selectivity of the reaction for all three catalysts in favor of the cis-pinane isomer. However, recycling of the Pd on the three tested supports varied greatly. If Pd\/C and Pd\/alumina were successfully recycled 13 and 14 times, respectively, Pd\/silica could be used only once to convert pinenes into pinanes. Remaining very effective during all 13 cycles, Pd\/C was the best catalyst\/support of the three tested ones for the solvent-free hydrogenation of pinene. The influence of H2 pressure on pinene conversion rates were investigated for Pd\/C catalyst. An extremely low leaching rate of palladium in pinenes and pinanes determined by ICP\/MS confirmed the heterogeneous nature of this catalytic solvent-free reaction.

Detailed understanding of competition between surface and solution as applied to PEMs requires selective labeling of polymers and\/or the application of techniques that allow chemically specific monitoring of film components, such as in-situ ATR\u2212FTIR spectroscopy. The trends observed with multilayers directly follow from the properties of PECs in solution. Effects of a number of parameters, such as the type of interacting polyelectrolyte chains, the ratio of their lengths, and ionic strength and pH of deposition solutions, on the likelihood of the multilayer stability or erosion are considered. Polycations with high density of primary amino groups and polyanions with SO3- or SO4- groups show the strongest interpolyelectrolyte binding, resulting in inhibited chain exchange within PECs and\/or PEMs. With weakly bound polyelectrolyte pairspolycations containing quaternary ammonium groups and carboxylate polyanionswater-soluble PECs are easily formed, often resulting in erosion of PEMs. For the latter case, we report a full phase diagram of polycation\/polyanion\/NaCl aqueous mixtures and show how ionic strength can be used to tune the deposition of PEMs at surfaces. In addition, we present that the phase behavior of PECs in solution also controls pH response of PEMs at surfaces. Better knowledge of the relationships between the PEMs and PECs allows rational prediction and control of deposition of a wide range of weak or permanently charged polyelectrolytes at surfaces.

In this paper, the nonlinear Poisson\u2212Boltzmann equation is used to model the electrical double layer and the lattice Boltzmann model coupled with the constraint of current continuity is used to simulate the microfluidic flow field in a rectangular microchannel with a step variation of surface potentials. This current continuity, including surface conduction, convection, and bulk conduction currents, has often been neglected in the literature for electroosmotic flow with nonuniform (heterogeneous) microchannels. Results show that step variation of ion distribution caused by step variation surface potential will influence significantly the electrical potential distribution along the channel and volumetric flow rate. For the system considered, we showed that the volumetric flow rate could have been overestimated by as much as 70% without consideration of the current continuity constraint.

The resulting more sophisticated model can simulate realistically the effect on PHs\/PHL or Ds (i) of salient structural features of the porous medium (notably pore size dispersion and network connectivity) and (ii) of vapor condensation, which inevitably accompanies multilayer adsorbate transport in reality. An extensive generic parametric study of these effects has been performed on this basis. The results indicate that the aforementioned effects are ordinarily unlikely to induce substantial deviations of observed PHs\/PHL behavior from the single-pore model benchmark. Thus, the utility of this simple model as a good basis for data analysis is confirmed, while the network model offers the possibility of exploiting external structural and other available information for a more refined interpretation of PHs\/PHL behavior in particular mesoporous solid\u2212vapor systems.

Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is uniquely suited to the study of U\u2212calcite systems. The sensitivity of the EXAFS spectrum to the local atomic Ca coordination about U(VI) in the calcite structure results in an increase in the number and amplitude of Ca signals as the U(VI) becomes more ordered within the crystal structure. Our X-ray microprobe (10-\u03bcm) measurements of an ancient 298 million-year-old organic-rich calcite (calcrete) clearly revealed three coordination shells of Ca atoms, defining a well-ordered calcite structure about uranyl to a distance of \u223c6.5 \u00c5. These results indicate that uranyl is incorporated at the Ca2+ site in calcite and that the uranyl environment may evolve over long time scales, becoming more calcite-like and more stable for long-term sequestration of uranium. These results therefore validate U-related dating methods and show that calcite can be effective at sequestering U in vadose zone sediments.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction to fuels and chemicals is an appealing alternative to traditional pathways to fuels and chemicals due to its intrinsic ability to couple to solar and wind energy sources. Formate (HCOO\u2013) is a key chemical for many industries; however, greater understanding is needed regarding the mechanism and key intermediates for HCOO\u2013 production. This work reports a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOO\u2013 on polycrystalline Sn surfaces, which have been identified as promising catalysts for selectively producing HCOO\u2013. Our results show that Sn electrodes produce HCOO\u2013, carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2) across a range of potentials and that HCOO\u2013 production becomes favored at potentials more negative than \u22120.8 V vs RHE, reaching a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 70% at \u22120.9 V vs RHE. Scaling relations for Sn and other transition metals are examined using experimental current densities and density functional theory (DFT) binding energies. While *COOH was determined to be the key intermediate for CO production on metal surfaces, we suggest that it is unlikely to be the primary intermediate for HCOO\u2013 production. Instead, *OCHO is suggested to be the key intermediate for the CO2RR to HCOO\u2013 transformation, and Sn\u2019s optimal *OCHO binding energy supports its high selectivity for HCOO\u2013. These results suggest that oxygen-bound intermediates are critical to understand the mechanism of CO2 reduction to HCOO\u2013 on metal surfaces."},{"title":"Femtosecond Spectroscopic Study of MLCT Excited-State Dynamics of Cr(CO)<sub>4<\/sub>(bpy): Excitation-Energy-Dependent Branching between CO Dissociation and Relaxation","abstract":"The excited-state dynamics of Cr(CO)4(bpy) were studied with pump\u2212probe time-resolved absorption spectroscopy in pyridine and CH2Cl2 solutions.

However, most photocatalytic systems involve rare and expensive platinum as the co-catalyst for water reduction, which appears to be the bottleneck in the development of economical and environmentally benign solar H2 production systems. Herein, we report a simple, efficient, and low-cost all-in-one photocatalytic H2 evolution system composed of a thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-linked COF (TpDTz) as the photoabsorber and an earth-abundant, noble-metal-free nickel-thiolate hexameric cluster co-catalyst assembled in situ in water, together with triethanolamine (TEoA) as the sacrificial electron donor. The high crystallinity, porosity, photochemical stability, and light absorption ability of the TpDTz COF enables excellent long-term H2 production over 70 h with a maximum rate of 941 \u03bcmol h\u20131 g\u20131, turnover number TONNi &gt; 103, and total projected TONNi &gt; 443 until complete catalyst depletion. The high H2 evolution rate and TON, coupled with long-term photocatalytic operation of this hybrid system in water, surpass those of many previously known organic dyes, carbon nitride, and COF-sensitized photocatalytic H2O reduction systems. Furthermore, we gather unique insights into the reaction mechanism, enabled by a specifically designed continuous-flow system for non-invasive, direct H2 production rate monitoring, providing higher accuracy in quantification compared to the existing batch measurement methods.

Biofilm electrode reactor (BER) is deemed as a promising bioreactor to regenerate the iron chelate. Although it has been proved that BER can significantly enhance the bioreduction of Fe(III)EDTA, the bioelectrochemistry mechanism involved in the bioreduction of Fe(III)EDTA remains unknown. This work aims to explore this mechanism via the analysis of the generation, utilization, and transformation of cathode electrons in the BER. The results indicate that the generation of cathode electrons follows Faraday\u2019s law. The generated cathode electrons were used to produce H2 and directly reduce Fe(III)EDTA in the BER. Meanwhile, the produced H2 served as an electron donor for bioreduction of Fe(III)EDTA. The excess H2 product was transformed to simple organics, e.g., methanol by the hydrogen autotrophy of Pseudomonas under the inorganic and anaerobic conditions. Overall, this work revealed that the reduction of Fe(III)EDTA in the BER was enhanced by both direct electrochemical reduction and indirect bioreduction using H2 as an intermediate. It is also interesting that the excess H2 product was transformed to methanol for microbial metabolism and energy storage in the BER."},{"title":"Sequential Photosubstitution of Carbon Monoxide by <i>(E)<\/i>-Cyclooctene in Hexacarbonyltungsten:\u2009 Structural Aspects, Multistep Photokinetics, and Quantum Yields","abstract":"The photochemical conversion of W(CO)6 (1) into a trans-W(CO)4(\u03b72-olefin)2 complex has been investigated using (E)-cyclooctene (eco) as a model olefin possessing extraordinary coordination properties. trans-W(CO)4(\u03b72-eco)2 (4) is generated as an equimolar mixture of two diastereoisomers (4a, S4 symmetry; 4b, D2 symmetry) which can be separated by fractional crystallization. The entire reaction sequence involves the intermediate formation of W(CO)5(\u03b72-eco) (2) and cis-W(CO)4(\u03b72-eco)2 (3:\u2009 two diastereoisomers, 3a and 3b, with apparent Cs and C2 symmetry, respectively). Complexes 2 and 3, although difficult to isolate from the photochemical reaction mixture, are conveniently accessible via alternative thermal ligand exchange routes.

The olefin double bonds, with trans-orthogonal arrangement in 4a, are eclipsed to a OC\u2212W\u2212CO axis in either case. The course of the conversion of 1 into the olefin-substituted products was monitored by quantitative IR spectroscopy. Photokinetic equations developed for this study describe the concentrations of all four components as implicit functions of the amount of light absorbed by the system, of the quantum yields of the individual photoprocesses, and of the UV\u2212vis absorbance coefficients of the compounds involved.

The removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, industrial chemicals, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCP) is paramount. As the concentrations of individual contaminants are typically low, frequent analytical screening is both laborious and costly. We propose and validate an approach for continuous monitoring by applying passive sampling with Empore disks in vessels that were designed to slow down the water flow, and thus uptake kinetics, and ensure that the uptake is only marginally dependent on the chemicals\u2019 physicochemical properties over a relatively narrow molecular size range. This design not only assured integrative sampling over 27 days for a broad range of chemicals but also permitted the use of a suite of bioanalytical tools as sum parameters, representative of mixtures of chemicals with a common mode of toxic action. Bioassays proved to be more sensitive than chemical analysis to assess the removal of organic micropollutants by reverse osmosis, followed by UV\/H2O2 treatment, as many individual compounds fell below the quantification limit of chemical analysis, yet still contributed to the observed mixture toxicity. Nonetheless in several cases, the responses in the bioassays were also below their quantification limits and therefore only three bioassays were evaluated here, representing nonspecific toxicity and two specific end points for estrogenicity and photosynthesis inhibition. Chemical analytical techniques were able to quantify 32 pesticides, 62 PCPPs, and 12 EDCs in reverse osmosis concentrate. However, these chemicals could explain only 1% of the nonspecific toxicity in the Microtox assay in the reverse osmosis concentrate and 0.0025% in the treated water. Likewise only 1% of the estrogenic effect in the E-SCREEN could be explained by the quantified EDCs after reverse osmosis. In comparison, &gt;50% of the estrogenic effect can typically be explained in sewage. Herbicidal activity could be fully explained by chemical analysis as the sampling period coincided with an illegal discharge and two herbicides dominated the mixture effect. The mass balance of the reverse osmosis process matched theoretical expectations for both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. Overall the investigated treatment train removed &gt;97% estrogenicity, &gt;99% herbicidal activity, and &gt;96% baseline toxicity, confirming the suitability of the treatment train for polishing water for indirect potable reuse. The product water was indistinguishable from local tap water in all three bioassays. This study demonstrates the suitability and robustness of passive sampling linked with bioanalytical tools for semicontinuous monitoring of advanced water treatment with respect to micropollutant removal."},{"title":"Biogenic Fe(III) Minerals Lower the Efficiency of Iron-Mineral-Based Commercial Filter Systems for Arsenic Removal","abstract":"Millions of people worldwide are affected by As (arsenic) contaminated groundwater. Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides sorb As efficiently and are therefore used in water purification filters. Commercial filters containing abiogenic Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides (GEH) showed varying As removal, and it was unclear whether Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria influenced filter efficiency. We found up to 107 Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria\/g dry-weight in GEH-filters and determined the performance of filter material in the presence and absence of Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. GEH-material sorbed 1.7 mmol As(V)\/g Fe and was \u223c8 times more efficient than biogenic Fe(III) minerals that sorbed only 208.3 \u03bcmol As(V)\/g Fe. This was also \u223c5 times more efficient than a 10:1-mixture of GEH-material and biogenic Fe(III) minerals that bound 322.6 \u03bcmol As(V)\/g Fe. Coprecipitation of As(V) with biogenic Fe(III) minerals removed 343.0 \u03bcmol As(V)\/g Fe, while As removal by coprecipitation with biogenic minerals in the presence of GEH-material was slightly less efficient as GEH-material only and yielded 1.5 mmol As(V)\/g Fe. The present study thus suggests that the formation of biogenic Fe(III) minerals lowers rather than increases As removal efficiency of the filters probably due to the repulsion of the negatively charged arsenate by the negatively charged biogenic minerals. For this reason we recommend excluding microorganisms from filters (e.g., by activated carbon filters) to maintain their high As removal capacity."},{"title":"Tip Enhanced Silver Growth on Shaped Controlled Nickel Nanocrystals","abstract":"We report on the synthesis of Ni\/Ag heterogeneous nanocrystals.

About 10% of all absorbed photons lead to an excitation of the lowest energy state. Of these excitations, less than 1% lead to a photon in the optical far-field.

In essence, this effective Hamiltonian method is equivalent to the quasidegenerate perturbation theory. But the difference lies in transforming the original Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian acting within a relatively small valence in the effective valence shell Hamiltonian method. One advantage of the method is that the spin\u2212orbit coupling energies of all valence states for both the neutral species and its ions are simultaneously determined with a similar accuracy from a single computation of the effective spin\u2212orbit coupling operator. Thus, fine structure splittings are predicted for a number of states of each system for which neither experiment nor theory is available. To assess the accuracy of the effective Hamiltonian method more extensively, test calculations are performed for the spin\u2212orbit splittings in the valence states of small diatomic hydrides and their ions. The calculated spin\u2212orbit splittings are generally in good agreement with experiments and with other ab initio computations."},{"title":"Experimental and Theoretical Studies of the Kinetics of the Reactions of OH Radicals with Acetic Acid, Acetic Acid-<i>d<\/i><sub>3<\/sub> and Acetic Acid-<i>d<\/i><sub>4<\/sub> at Low Pressure","abstract":"The kinetics of the reactions of OH with acetic acid, acetic acid-d3 and acetic acid-d4 were studied from 2 to 5 Torr and 263\u2212373 K using a discharge flow system with resonance fluorescence detection of the OH radical.

Both strain-induced crystallization (SIC) under uniaxial loading (D-PEF and D-PET) and crystallization under static conditions (TC-PEF and TC-PET) were used to determine the effect of mechanical stretching. It appears that, although the crystalline systems are the same, the inner organization of the amorphous phases is influenced by stretching. In addition to the increased incidence of the more extended aliphatic chain conformation (trans), stretching appears to reduce the number of activated hydrogen bonds between segments, which are more constrained in PEF than in PET. The effect of stretching on the \u03b2-relaxation, which is related to local motions of carbonyl groups, showed that PEF carbonyl groups of amorphous regions are freed by the stretching.

In this letter we demonstrate that ultrasonic standing waves in the MHz frequency range can levitate, propel, rotate, align, and assemble metallic microrods (2 \u03bcm long and 330 nm diameter) in water as well as in solutions of high ionic strength. Metallic rods levitated to the midpoint plane of a cylindrical cell when the ultrasonic frequency was tuned to create a vertical standing wave. Fast axial motion of metallic microrods at \u223c200 \u03bcm\/s was observed at the resonant frequency using continuous or pulsed ultrasound. Segmented metal rods (AuRu or AuPt) were propelled unidirectionally with one end (Ru or Pt, respectively) consistently forward.

Metallic rods also aligned and self-assembled into long spinning chains, which in the case of bimetallic rods had a head-to-tail alternating structure. These chains formed ring or streak patterns in the levitation plane. The diameter or distance between streaks was roughly half the wavelength of the ultrasonic excitation.

To eliminate the possibility of labeling native cysteine, the single cysteine in the wild-type enzyme was mutated to a serine without any change in activity. The loop-cysteine mutant was then labeled with acrylodan, an environment-sensitive fluorescence probe. The fluorescence increased and blue-shifted upon binding to lipid vesicles, consistent with a change into a more hydrophobic, i.e., lipid, environment. This acrylodan-labeled cholesterol oxidase was used to explore the pH, ionic strength, and headgroup dependence of binding. Between pH 6 and 10, there was no significant change in binding affinity. Incorporation of anionic lipids (phosphatidylserine) into the vesicles did not increase the binding affinity nor did altering the ionic strength. These experiments suggested that the interactions are primarily driven by hydrophobic effects not ionic effects. Using vesicles doped with either 5-doxyl phosphatidylcholine, 10-doxyl phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidyl-tempocholine, quenching of acrylodan fluorescence was observed upon binding. Using the parallax method of London [Chattopadhyay, A., and London, E. (1987) Biochemistry26, 39\u221245], the acrylodan ring is calculated to be 8.1 \u00b1 2.5 \u00c5 from the center of the lipid bilayer. Modeling the acrylodan-cysteine residue as an extended chain suggests that the backbone of the loop does not penetrate into the lipid bilayer but interacts with the headgroups, i.e., the choline. These results demonstrate that cholesterol oxidase interacts directly with the lipid bilayer and sits on the surface of the membrane.

The reaction conditions have been optimized by the screening of different chiral Lewis acids, solvents, and bases, and it was found that the copper(II)\u2212tert-butyl bisoxazoline complex in combination with triethylamine catalyzed a highly enantioselective reaction giving optically active \u03b2-nitro-\u03b1-hydroxy esters in high yields and with excellent enantiomeric excesses. The scope of the reaction is demonstrated by the reaction of a variety of different \u03b1-keto esters. The catalytic enantioselective Henry reaction of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated-\u03b1-keto esters proceeds as a 1,2-addition reaction exclusively, in contrast to the uncatalyzed reaction where both the 1,2- and 1,4-addition products are formed. It is demonstrated that the \u03b2-nitro-\u03b1-hydroxy esters can be converted into, e.g., Boc-protected \u03b2-amino-\u03b1-hydroxy esters in high yields and without loss of optical purity. The mechanism for the reaction is discussed, and it is postulated that both the \u03b1-keto ester and nitromethane\/nitronate is coordinated to the metal center during the reaction course.

SiH4 is a pyrophoric gas, which frequently causes fatal accidents in experiments. In this study, therefore, we propose the use of a HTCVD method using tetramethylsilane (TMS), a cheap and safe precursor, for growing SiC bulk crystals. Although TMS contains C four times more than Si in its chemical formula, a stoichiometric SiC layer was successfully synthesized from TMS in the presence of a high concentration of H2 based on the thermodynamic process design. 6H-SiC single crystals were successfully grown on a 6H-SiC seed crystal using the same process conditions. The resulting single crystalline layer was evaluated by rocking curve analysis by X-ray diffraction, which showed that the crystal properties of the grown SiC layer were improved compared to the seed crystals. This suggests that the TMS-based HTCVD method is feasible for practical use in SiC bulk growth."},{"title":"Bacterial Expression Systems for Enzymatic Activity in Droplet-Based Microfluidics","abstract":"Functional screenings in droplet-based microfluidics require the analysis of various types of activities of individual cells. When screening for enzymatic activities, the link between the enzyme of interest and the information-baring molecule, the DNA, must be maintained to relate phenotypes to genotypes. This linkage is crucial in directed evolution experiments or for the screening of natural diversity. Micro-organisms are classically used to express enzymes from nucleic acid sequences. However, little information is available regarding the most suitable expression system for the sensitive detection of enzymatic activity at the single-cell level in droplet-based microfluidics. Here, we compare three different expression systems for l-asparaginase (l-asparagine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.1), an enzyme of therapeutic interest that catalyzes the conversion of l-asparagine to l-aspartic acid and ammonia. We developed three expression vectors to produce and localize l-asparaginase (l-ASNase) in E. coli either in the cytoplasm, on the surface of the inner membrane (display), or in the periplasm. We show that the periplasmic expression is the most optimal strategy combining both a good yield and a good accessibility for the substrate without the need for lysing the cells. We suggest that periplasmic expression may provide a very efficient platform for screening applications at the single-cell level in microfluidics."},{"title":"Single-Molecule Spectroscopy of Conjugated Polymers","abstract":"The molecular structure, photochemistry, and device physics of conjugated polymers have been investigated by single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS), using the unique ability of this technique to unravel complex spectra and dynamics.

Derivative peak fitting of diffuse reflectance UV\u2013visible spectra (DPR) is presented as an inexpensive, fast, and quantitative method to estimate both the composition of a multiphase semiconductor sample as well as the band gap energies of each component semiconductor in the mixture. Degussa P25 TiO2, a widely used catalyst support and semiconductor photocatalyst, is a mixture of anatase and rutile polymorphs. The as-received P25 samples were subjected to grinding, sieving, and calcination or a combination of these operations. Samples were analyzed via DPR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy to quantify the percentage of anatase and rutile polymorphs present in each sample. Compositional measurements from DPR were in good quantitative agreement with XRD and Raman analysis. The application of in situ UV\u2013visible spectroscopy DPR allowed for the on-stream determination of the onset temperature for rutilization during calcination, which occurred just above 823 K. In situ analysis of the ground and sieved samples during calcination revealed that grinding and sieving (between 45 and 53 \u03bcm) lowered the onset of rutilization to 673 K, leading to an increase in the formation of rutile when calcined at 773 K compared to as-received P25 calcined at the same temperature. However, the same process reduced the overall extent of rutilization at a higher temperature of 973 K. Changes in the exposed facets and shapes of the anatase crystallite, as indicated by XRD, were implicated in both reducing the rutilization onset temperature as well as leading to an overall greater resistance to rutilization. The quantitative success of the DPR method in this study may lead to application in other systems of mixed semiconductors."},{"title":"Comment on \u201cSpectator Ions ARE Important!

After CO or C2H4 reduction of silica-supported CrVI ions to CrII ions in the precatalyst, exposure to ethylene results in the formation of organoCrIII sites that are capable of initiating polymerization without recourse to an external alkylating cocatalyst. In this work, a Phillips catalyst prepared, via sol\u2013gel chemistry, as a mesoporous, optically transparent monolith was reduced with CO to the spectroscopically determined CrII end point. Ethylene causes rapid reoxidation of these CrII sites to CrIII, even at low temperatures. Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopies reveal that the resulting sites contain a vinyl ligand, described as (\u2261SiO)2CrIII\u2013CH\u2550CH2 although likely with a higher coordination number, which are capable of initiating polymerization. The formation of these vinyl sites is an incommensurate redox reaction involving one-electron oxidation of CrII via ethylene disproportionation.

The most significant structural differences between the trefoil domain in the monomer and dimer TFF3 are in the orientations of the N-terminal 310-helix (residues 10\u221212) and in the presence in the dimer of an additional 310-helix (residues 53\u221255) outside of the core region. The TFF3 dimer forms a more compact structure as compared with the TFF1 dimer where the two trefoil domains are connected by a flexible region with the monomer units being at variable distances from each other and in many different orientations. Although TFF2 is also a compact structure, the dispositions of its monomer units are very different from those of TFF3. The structural differences between the dimers result in the two putative receptor\/ligand binding sites that remain solvent exposed in the dimeric structures having very different dispositions in the different dimers.

We used advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction techniques to probe the structural evolution in the atomic level during these crystallizations. Based on the in-depth structure study, it can be inferred that both the different effects arise from the stronger ability of La3+ ions in attracting F\u2013 ions than that of Pb2+ ions. Intensive upconversion visible luminescence was observed in these glasses. The NMR and the upconversion luminescence results imply that most Er3+ ions are dissolved in the LaF3 crystal rather than in the PbF2 crystal and the glass phases even when the content of the LaF3 crystal is as small as less than 1 mol %.

This solution is valid from low frequencies to indefinitely high frequencies and has no restriction on zeta potential, double-layer thickness, or electrolyte composition. The solution has been used to calculate the dynamic electrophoretic mobility of a particle for a wide range of double-layer thicknesses and zeta potentials. The solution agrees with analytic approximations obtained previously by other authors under the conditions of a thin double layer and low zeta potential. The results are also consistent with calculations valid at frequencies where the ion diffusion length extends a significant distance beyond the double layer as obtained by another numerical technique.

The successive transitions between phases A, B, C, D, and E, sorted in terms of increasing stability (decreasing chemical potential), were proved to give rise to hysteresis loops that appeared during the water desorption isotherm for various temperatures. Our sorbate water molecular dynamics simulations are in agreement with previous pulsed-field gradient NMR results and showed that the sorbate diffusivity rises with increasing loading because of a decrease of the free energy barrier for surmounting the sorbent windows, which are being primarily water-populated. Moreover, we found that the phase-dependent water diffusivity decreases for all loadings as a result of the gradual reduction in width of the aforesaid apertures upon transitioning from phase A to E."},{"title":"Fluorine-Ion-Mediated Electrodeposition of Rhombus-Like ZnFOH Nanorod Arrays: An Intermediate Route to Novel ZnO Nanoarchitectures","abstract":"Novel rhombus-like ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays were achieved via a facile two-step synthesis strategy based on first a low-temperature aqueous electrodeposition of vertically aligned rhombic ZnFOH NR arrays in the presence of fluoride and second a pyrolysis of ZnFOH intermediate into ZnO with the same morphology. The fluorine-ion-mediated electrodeposition mechanism of ZnFOH was confirmed for the first time, and the proposed formation process that the rhombus-like ZnO NRs characterized by mesoporous structure derived from the electrodeposited ZnFOH intermediate was corroborated by systematic structural characterization of the as-prepared products. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on the rhombus-like ZnO NR arrays with a larger surface roughness factor was assembled, and a higher conversion efficiency of 0.69% was attained in comparison to 0.47% of the DSSC based on the hexagon-like ZnO NR arrays electrodeposited in the absence of fluoride.

This pattern substantiates the presence of a 2-D magnetic structure with ferromagnetic intradimer exchange and interdimer antiferromagnetic exchange of weaker magnitude. The opposite signs of the interactions are ascribed to the local symmetries of the Cu(II) and Mn(II) ions.

In particular, it is unknown why hydrated lime putty behaves as an irreversible colloid once dried. Such effect dramatically affects the reactivity and rheology of hydrated lime dispersions. Here we show that the irreversible colloidal behavior of Ca(OH)2 dispersions is the result of an oriented aggregation mechanism triggered by drying. Kinetic stability and particle size distribution analysis of oven-dried slaked lime or commercial dry hydrate dispersions exhibit a significant increase in settling speed and particle (cluster) size in comparison to slaked lime putty that has never been dried. Drying-related particle aggregation also leads to a significant reduction in surface area. Electron microscopy analyses show porous, randomly oriented, micron-sized clusters that are dominant in the dspersions both before and after drying. However, oriented aggregation of the primary Ca(OH)2 nanocrystals (\u223c60 nm in size) is also observed. Oriented aggregation occurs both before and during drying, and although limited before drying, it is extensive during drying. Nanocrystals self-assemble in a crystallographically oriented manner either along the \u3008100\u3009 or equivalent \u3008110\u3009 directions, or along the Ca(OH)2 basal planes, i.e., along [001]. While random aggregation appears to be reversible, oriented aggregation is not. The strong coherent bonding among oriented nanoparticles prevents disaggregation upon redispersion in water. The observed irreversible colloidal behavior associated with drying of Ca(OH)2 dispersions has important implications in heritage conservation, particularly considering that nowadays hydrated lime is often the preferred alternative to portland cement in architectural heritage conservation. Finally, our study demonstrates that, fortuitously, hydrated lime could be one of the first nanomaterials used by mankind.

The mixing time using tracer impulses and experimental continuous crystallization runs to understand the performance of process variables, with focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), process video microscope measurements, and off-line particle size analytics, is reported. The model system was phthalic acid crystallization from water. The effects of ultrasound power and residence time on the crystallization dynamics and on the product crystal size distribution (CSD) were studied. The use of ultrasound was found to be vital in the crystallization operations in order to prevent pipe clogging. It was shown that an increase in ultrasound power improves mixing in tubular reactors, and it decreases the product CSD, most probably due to nucleation. Also, an increase in residence time decreases the CSD due to an increase in ultrasound irradiation time during crystal growth. The video-microscope-based relative backscatter index signal was more sensitive to crystallization startup in this system in comparison to FBRM chord lengths. The continuous crystallization process dead time was found to follow fluid mixing dynamics by monitoring relative backscatter index signals as the flow rate and US power were increased. The steady-state crystallization conditions were found to take more than 2 reactor residence times on the basis of continuous crystallization experiments."},{"title":"Hierarchical Inorganic Assemblies for Artificial Photosynthesis","abstract":"Artificial photosynthesis is an attractive approach for renewable fuel generation because it offers the prospect of a technology suitable for deployment on highly abundant, non-arable land.

For this chemistry to be observed, structural changes upon electron transfer are often needed to shift the 1e\u2013 redox potentials to a condition of potential inversion where 2e\u2013 transfer becomes favorable. Nickel(II) dithiocarbamate complexes take advantage of these conditions to drive 2e\u2013 oxidation from NiII to NiIV. Here, we have studied the electrochemistry of NiII(dtc)2, where dtc\u2013 is N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate in an acetonitrile solvent as a function of the scan rate and added pyridine to gain further insight into the mechanism for its 2e\u2013 oxidation to [NiIV(dtc)3]+. The scan rate dependence revealed evidence for an ECE mechanism in which the chemical step constituted ligand exchange between [NiIII(dtc)2]+ and NiII(dtc)2. A pseudo-first-order rate constant for this reaction of 34 s\u20131 was obtained at 1 mM NiII(dtc)2. The addition of pyridine to the electrolyte solution showed pronounced changes to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) that were consistent with the formation of a pyridine-bound NiIII complex, [NiIII(dtc)2(py)2]+, which was stable at high scan rates but decomposed to [NiIV(dtc)3]+ at low scan rates. The observed decomposition rate constant was well modeled with two parallel decay pathways, one through the dipyridine [NiIII(dtc)2(py)2]+ and another through a monopyridine [NiIII(dtc)2py]+. Overall, these data point to a mechanism for oxidation from NiII(dtc)2 to [NiIV(dtc)3]+ that proceeds through an undercoordinated [NiIII(dtc)2]+ complex, which can be trapped on the time scale of CV experiments using pyridine ligands. These studies provide insight into how we may be able to control 1e\u2013 versus 2e\u2013 redox chemistry using the coordination environment and nickel oxidation state."},{"title":"Intermediate-Sized Conjugated Donor Molecules for Organic Solar Cells: Comparison of Benzodithiophene and Benzobisthiazole-Based Cores","abstract":"Two intermediate-sized donor molecules, BBTz-X and BDT-X, have been synthesized by the Stille coupling between 4-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(trimethylstannyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophen-2-yl)-7-(5\u2032-hexyl-[2,2\u2032-bithiophen]-5-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine and either 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,6-diiodobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d\u2032]bis(thiazole) or 2,6-dibromo-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene, respectively. Both oxidation and reduction potentials for BBTz-X are anodically shifted relative to those for BDT-X, but the oxidation potential is more sensitive to the identity of the core; this is consistent with what is seen for DFT-calculated HOMO and LUMO energies and with a slightly blue-shifted absorption maximum for BBTz-X. Although DFT calculations, along with crystal structures of related compounds, suggest more planar molecular structures for BBTz-X than for BDT-X, film structures and the effects of various annealing processes on these films, as revealed by GIWAXS, are similar.

Metallic ZrTe3 conserved its p-type conduction under pressure, and its Seebeck coefficient curve displayed a distinct crossover near 2 GPa. Semiconducting ZrSe3 demonstrated more remarkable responses to applied pressure, which included a multiorder gradual drop in its electrical resistance value up to 9 GPa and an n\u2013p inversion of the dominant conduction type around 6 GPa. Furthermore, we found that a thermoelectric power factor of ZrSe3 may be greatly improved under high applied pressure, achieving a value of an order of 3.5 mW\/(K2 m) at 9.5 GPa. Thus, an appropriately strained p-type ZrSe3 with a dramatically reduced band gap value turns to be a promising thermoelectrics. One can anticipate that ZrSe3\u2013ZrTe3 solid solutions, in which the addition of ZrTe3 should decrease the band gap value of ZrSe3 in a controlled manner, could also demonstrate high thermoelectric performance parameters. Reversibility and reproducibility of the pressure-driven changes in the electronic properties of ZrSe3 suggest that it has a potential for other industrial applications linked to cyclic stress loads, for example, in n\u2013p switches or control of p\u2013n\u2013p transistor elements."},{"title":"Single-Particle Electrophoresis in Nanochannels","abstract":"Electrophoretic mobilities and particle sizes of individual Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) capsids were measured in nanofluidic channels with two nanopores in series.

There is a strong correlation between molecular architecture and aggregation mechanisms: the addition of polar functional groups and heteroatoms resulted in compounds that are more prone to aggregation and form large, micrometer-sized clusters, while the increased steric hindrance imposed by alkoxy side chains led to stable nanometer-sized aggregates. These conclusions underline the strong structure\u2013function relationship of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as asphaltenes, examined here over multiple length scales in a single solvent.

Atomic absorption studies demonstrate that the native B. fragilis enzyme tightly binds 2 mol of Zn(II) and, along with mutagenesis studies, that the presence of both metal ions is required for full catalytic activity. EPR spectroscopy was used to confirm that the Co(II)-substituted \u03b2-lactamase binds 2 mol of Co(II) per mole of enzyme, that the two Co(II)'s are high-spin and probably uncoupled, with apparent g values of 6.5, 4.2, and 2.0, and that the coordination number of the Co(II) is 5 or 6. This number of ligands for the Co(II)-substituted enzyme is confirmed by UV\u2212Vis spectra, which demonstrate the presence of very weak d\u2212d transitions between 550 and 650 nm (\u03b5 \u2248 30 M-1\u00b7cm-1) and an intense feature at 320 nm (\u03b5 \u2248 1570 M-1\u00b7cm-1). The latter is assigned to a cysteine sulfur to Co(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer band, and this assignment is confirmed by the disappearance of this band in the UV\u2212Vis spectrum of a Co(II)-substituted C168S mutant. 1H NMR studies on the Co(II)-substituted enzyme suggest the presence of three histidine ligands bound to Co(II). Taken together, these studies support the sequence comparison study of Rasmussen et al., in which there is a catalytic metal-binding site with three histidines and one cysteine (C168). The remaining ligands are postulated to be water molecules involved in catalysis. Mutagenesis studies, in combination with activity assays and metal-binding studies, have been used to identify Asp61, Asp90, Asp152, and Asp183 as possible ligands to the second metal-binding site, with Asp90 and Asp152 having a pronounced effect on kcat. These results are discussed in light of the recent crystal structure of the metallo-\u03b2-lactamase from B. cereus.

CHIKV is transmitted by the mosquitoes and causes Chikungunya fever. CHIKV outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the countries of Indian and Pacific Oceans. In 2013, CHIKV cases were registered for the first time in the Americas on the Caribbean islands. There is currently no vaccine to prevent or medicines to treat CHIKV infection. The CHIKV nonstructural protease (nsP2) is a promising potential target for the development of drugs against CHIKV infection because this protein is one of the key components of the viral replication complex and is involved in multiple steps of virus infection. In this work, novel analogues of the potential CHIKV nsP2 protease inhibitor, first reported by Das et al. in 2016, were identified using molecular modeling methods, synthesized, and evaluated in vitro. The optimization of the structure of the inhibitor allowed to increase the antiviral activity of the compound 2\u201310 times. The possible mechanism of action of the identified potential inhibitors of the CHIKV nsP2 protease was studied in detail using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. According to the MD results, the most probable mechanism of action is the blocking of conformational changes in the nsP2 protease required for substrate recognition and binding."},{"title":"Energetics and Structure of Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)","abstract":"The standard molar enthalpies of formation and sublimation of crystalline (monoclinic, space group P21\/c) nicotinic acid (NA), at 298.15 K, were determined as \u0394fHm\u00b0(NA, cr) = \u2212344.7 \u00b1 1.2 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121 and \u0394subHm\u00b0(NA) = 112.1 \u00b1 0.5 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121 by using combustion calorimetry, drop-sublimation Calvet microcalorimetry, and the Knudsen effusion method. The experimental determinations were all based on a sample of NIST Standard Reference Material 2151, which was characterized in terms of chemical purity, phase purity, and morphology. From the above results, \u0394fHm\u00b0(NA, g) = \u2212232.6 \u00b1 1.3 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121 could be derived. On the basis of this value and on published experimental data, the enthalpy of the isodesmic reaction nicotinic acid(g) + benzene(g) \u2192 benzoic acid(g) + pyridine(g) was calculated as \u22123.6 \u00b1 2.7 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121 and compared with the corresponding predictions by the B3LYP\/cc-pVTZ (\u22123.6 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), B3LYP\/aug-cc-pVTZ (\u22123.7 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), B3LYP\/6-311++G(d,p) (\u22124.2 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), G3MP2 (\u22124.3 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), and CBS-QB3 (\u22124.0 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121) quantum chemistry models.

These data can therefore be used as benchmarks for discussing the energetics of nicotinic acid in the gaseous and crystalline states and, in particular, to evaluate differences imparted to solid forms by the production and processing methods. Such differences are perhaps at the root of the significant inconsistencies found between the published enthalpies of sublimation of this important active pharmaceutical ingredient and thermochemical standard. The molecular packing in the crystalline phase studied in this work was also discussed and its influence on the molecular structure of nicotinic acid was analyzed by comparing bond distances and angles published for the solid state with those predicted by the B3LYP\/cc-pVTZ method. No advantage in terms of accuracy of the structural predictions was found by the use of the larger aug-cc-pVTZ or 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets."},{"title":"Density and Solubility of Nafion:\u2009 Recast, Annealed, and Commercial Films","abstract":"The density of Nafion membranes wetted in water and acetonitrile and the solubility of Nafion in a 50:50 ethanol\/water mixture are reported.

Calculating free energy differences between substituents that constitute large volume or flexibility jumps in chemical space is difficult for free energy methods in general, and for MS\u03bbD in particular, due to large free energy barriers in alchemical space. This study demonstrates that a simple biasing potential can flatten these barriers and introduces an algorithm that determines system specific biasing potential coefficients. Two sources of error, deep traps at the end points and solvent disruption by hard-core potentials, are identified. Both scale with the size of the perturbed substituent and are removed by sharp biasing potentials and a new soft-core implementation, respectively. MS\u03bbD with landscape flattening is demonstrated on two sets of molecules: derivatives of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor geldanamycin and derivatives of benzoquinone. In the benzoquinone system, landscape flattening leads to 2 orders of magnitude improvement in transition rates between substituents and robust solvation free energies. Landscape flattening opens up new applications for MS\u03bbD by enabling larger chemical perturbations to be sampled with improved precision and accuracy."},{"title":"Multimodal Sensing with a Three-Dimensional Piezoresistive Structure","abstract":"Sensors that reproduce the complex characteristics of cutaneous receptors in the skin have important potential in the context of artificial systems for controlled interactions with the physical environment.

The three phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) were dipetroselinoyl-PE, dioleoyl-PE, and divaccenoyl-PE, which have double bonds in positions 6, 9, and 11, respectively. These lipids represent a group of structurally homologous compounds whose physical properties have been compared. We also used a fluorescent probe, 4-[(n-dodecylthio)methyl]-7-(N,N-dimethylamino)coumarin to measure the relative interfacial polarities of LUVs containing each of the three PEs. We find dipetroselinoyl-PE allows the least access of the fluorescent probe to the membrane. This is also the lipid that shows the lowest activation of PKC. The activity of PKC was found to correlate best with the interfacial properties of the three PEs rather than with the curvature energy of the membrane. The results show the sensitivity of the activity of PKC to small changes in lipid structure.

Cyclopropane-derived peptide mimics are novel in that they are among the few replacements that locally orient the peptide backbone and the amino acid side chain in a predefined manner. Although these dipeptide isosteres have been employed to orient amino acid side chains mimicking the gauche(\u2212) conformation of \u03c71-space, their ability to project the side chains into an anti orientation has not been evaluated. As a first step toward this goal, the conformationally constrained pseudopeptides 8 and 10 and their corresponding flexible analogues 9 and 11 were prepared and tested as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These compounds are analogues of 4 and 5, which were known to be potent MMP inhibitors. The anti orientations of the isopropyl side chain in 8 and the aromatic ring in 10 relative to the peptide backbone substituents on the cyclopropane were predicted to correspond to the known orientations of the P1\u2018 and P2\u2018 side chains of 5 when bound to MMPs. Hence, 8 and 10 were designed explicitly to probe topological features of the S1\u2018 or the S2\u2018 binding pockets of the MMPs. They were also designed to explore the importance of the P1\u2018\u2212P2\u2018 amide group, which is known to form highly conserved hydrogen bonds in several MMP-inhibitor complexes, and the viability of introducing a retro amide linkage between P2\u2018 and P3\u2018. Pseudopeptides 8 and 9 were found to be weak competitive inhibitors of a series of MMPs. Any entropically favorable conformational constraints that were induced by the cyclopropane in 8 were thus overwhelmed by the loss of the hydrogen bonding capability associated with the P1\u2018\u2212P2\u2018 amide group. On the other hand, compounds 10 and 11, which contain a P2\u2018\u2212P3\u2018 retro amide group, were modest competitive inhibitors of a series of MMPs. The results obtained for 10 and 11 suggest that there may be a loss of hydrogen bonding capability associated with introducing the P2\u2018\u2212P3\u2018 retro amide group. However, because the conformationally constrained pseudopeptide 10 was significantly more potent than its flexible analogue 11, trisubstituted cyclopropanes related to 3 may serve as useful rigid dipeptide replacements in some biologically active pseudopeptides.

Inhalable microparticles (MP) were prepared by spray-drying. Isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and diethylenetriamine nitric oxide adduct (DETA\/NO) were incorporated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with encapsulation efficiencies of &gt;90% to obtain MP yields of \u223c70%.

Significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher dose-dependent killing of intracellular Mtb by MP compared to equivalent amounts of drugs in solution was observed on estimation of colony forming units (CFU) surviving 24 h after exposure to drugs or MP. The cytotoxicity of MP toward macrophages was lower than that of dissolved drugs. It was concluded that inhalable MP can target NO donors to the macrophage, control NO release in the macrophage cytosol, and reduce Mtb CFU by up to 3-log in 24 h, at doses that are much lower than those required for cardiovascular effects."},{"title":"Amphiphilic Cationic \u03b2<sup>3R3<\/sup>-Peptides: Membrane Active Peptidomimetics and Their Potential as Antimicrobial Agents","abstract":"We introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic \u03b23R3-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents.

The transient IR data reveal the occurrence of an efficient alkyne to allene isomerization of the spacer with a time constant increasing from a few hundreds of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds with solvent viscosity. This process is faster than the vibrational cooling of the Franck\u2013Condon excited state, indicative of nonequilibrium dynamics. The transient electronic absorption and fluorescence data evidence that this transformation is accompanied by a charge separation between the donor and the acceptor subunits. The allene character of the spacer implies an orthogonal orientation of the donor and acceptor moieties, similar to that proposed for twisted intramolecular charge-transfer states. Such states are often invoked in the excited-state dynamics of donor\u2013acceptor dyads, but their involvement could never be unambiguously evidenced spectroscopically. The alkyne\u2013allene isomerization involves not only a torsional motion but also a bending of the molecule due to the sp to sp2 rehybridization of one of the alkyne carbon atoms. This twisted and rehybridized intramolecular charge transfer (\u201cTRICT\u201d) state decays back to the planar and linear alkyne ground state on a time scale decreasing from a few hundred to ten picoseconds upon going from weakly to highly polar solvents.

The results are compared with those obtained within extended Unified Theory (UT), contact and Markovian approximations, and a widely accepted exponential model.

In such conditions and under permanent illumination IET is the sole formalism appropriate for a full time-scale (non-Markovian) description of system relaxation. The original program for solving nonlinear IET equations for particle concentrations was developed and first used to calculate the kinetics of relaxation to equilibrium and to a stationary regime.

However, disulfide bonds are formed between Shaker subunits in intact cells exposed to oxidizing conditions. Upon electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, intersubunit disulfide bond formation was detected by the presence of four high molecular weight adducts of Shaker protein. This result suggests that intracellular cysteine residues are in sufficiently close proximity in the native structure of the Shaker channel to form intersubunit disulfide bonds. To test this hypothesis, wild-type and mutant Shaker proteins were exposed to oxidizing conditions in intact cells. Intersubunit disulfide bond formation was eliminated upon serine substitution of either C96 in the amino terminal or C505 in the carboxyl terminal of the protein. In contrast, disulfide bond formation was not eliminated upon serine substitution of both C301 and C308 in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments S2 and S3. Exposure of Shaker-expressing cells to oxidizing conditions did not significantly alter the amplitude, kinetics, or voltage dependence of the Shaker current, demonstrating that the native tertiary and quaternary structures of the channel were maintained under oxidizing conditions. These results indicate that intersubunit disulfide bonds form between C96 and C505, providing evidence that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of adjacent subunits are in proximity in the native structure of the channel. The disulfide-bonded adducts were found to represent a dimer, a trimer, and two forms of tetramer, one linear and one circular, containing one, two, three, or four disulfide bonds, respectively. These results provide a direct biochemical demonstration that Shaker K+ channels contain four pore-forming subunits.

To investigate the distribution of labile iron, our research has been focused on the development of fluorescent iron sensors targeting the endosomal\/lysosomal system. Following the recent introduction of a series of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (HPO) based fluorescent probes we present here two novel HPO sensors capable of accumulating and monitoring iron exclusively in endosomal\/lysosomal compartments. Flow cytometric and confocal microscopy studies in murine macrophages revealed endosomal\/lysosomal sequestration of the probes and high responsiveness toward alterations of vesicular labile iron concentrations. This allowed assessment of cellular iron status with high sensitivity in response to the clinically applied medications desferrioxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox. The probes represent a powerful class of sensors for quantitative iron detection and clinical real-time monitoring of subcellular labile iron levels in health and disease."},{"title":"Pore-Water Carbonate and Phosphate As Predictors of Arsenate Toxicity in Soil","abstract":"Phytotoxicity of inorganic contaminants is influenced by the presence of competing ions at the site of uptake. In this study, interaction of soil pore-water constituents with arsenate toxicity was investigated in cucumber (Cucumis sativa L) using 10 contrasting soils. Arsenate phytotoxicity was shown to be related to soluble carbonate and phosphate. The data indicated that dissolved phosphate and carbonate had an antagonistic impact on arsenate toxicity to cucumber. To predict arsenate phytotoxicity in soils with a diverse range of soil solution properties, both carbonate and phosphate were required. The relationship between arsenic and pore-water toxicity parameters was established initially using multiple regression. In addition, based on the relationship with carbonate and phosphate we successively applied a terrestrial biotic ligand-like model (BLM) including carbonate and phosphate. Estimated effective concentrations from the BLM-like parametrization were strongly correlated to measured arsenate values in pore-water (R2 = 0.76, P &lt; 0.001). The data indicates that an ion interaction model similar to the BLM for arsenate is possible, potentially improving current risk assessments at arsenic and co-contaminated soils."},{"title":"How Important is the Host (Semiconductor Nanoparticles) Identity and Absolute Band Gap in Host-Sensitized Dopant Photoluminescence?","abstract":"This work reports the host (semiconductor nanoparticles) sensitized dopant (lanthanides, Ln) photoluminescence in near band gap matched Sn(Ln)O2 and Zn(Ln)S [Ln = Sm, Tb] nanoparticles to address the importance of the nanoparticle identity and absolute band gap in the underlying process. While the sensitization was evident in the Sn(Sm)O2 and Zn(Tb)S nanoparticles, the same was not observed in the Sn(Tb)O2 and Zn(Sm)S nanoparticles.

It was found that oxygen doped into LaF3 can be mobile through introduced anion vacancy and LaO0.6F1.8 exhibits the high oxide ion conductivity, which is comparable with those in doped Bi2O3-based oxides. The oxide ion conductivity in LaO0.6F1.8 was further improved by simultaneous doping of SrO, SrF2, and NaF. The highest conductivity is achieved with the composition La0.9Sr0.1Na0.05O0.4F2.0 in the present study. La0.9Sr0.1Na0.05O0.4F2.0 is chemically stable in oxygen partial pressure from 1 to 10-21 atm, and almost the theoretical electromotive force is exhibited in the oxygen gas-concentration cell. The conductivity of oxygen-doped LaF3 was further confirmed by the dc polarization method. No polarization in conductivity was observed over 24 h, and also no segregation of F- ion at positive electrode was noticed. Furthermore, desorption of F2 from lattice was not observed. Therefore, it was confirmed that oxygen-doped LaF3 exhibits oxide ion conductivity. The chemical stability of La0.9Sr0.1O0.4F2.0 was further studied, and it was confirmed that F-rich lanthanum oxyfluoride is highly stable against humidity not only at elevated but also at room temperature.

Furthermore, the dynamic viscoelastic and mechanical behaviors of these cured elastomers were investigated. Amazingly, the damping factor (tan \u03b4) of the homopolymer of \u03b2-myrcene increased to 2.8 and exhibited a good damping potential. In addition, the satisfying wet skid resistance and rolling resistance performance were obtained for the copolymer with styrene.

In this research, a new synthesis method based on a solid-state electrochemical reaction was demonstrated, which can be made available for intercalation and ion substitution. It was referred to as proton-driven ion introduction (PDII). The protons generated by the electrolytic dissociation of hydrogen drive other monovalent cations along a high electric field in the solid state. Utilizing this mechanism, Li+, Na+, K+, Cu+, and Ag+ were intercalated into a layered TaS2 single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. This liquid-free process of ion introduction allows the application of high voltage around several kilovolts to the sample. Such a high electric field strongly accelerates ion substitution. Actually, compared to conventional solid-state reaction, PDII introduced 15 times the amount of K into Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-structured Na3\u2013xKxV2(PO4)3. The obtained materials exhibited a thermodynamically metastable phase, which has not been reported so far.

Their structures were elucidated through LC\/DAD-MS and NMR analysis and were found to correspond to a pyranoanthocyanin moiety linked to substituted cinnamyl substituents. The structures of these compounds are very similar to the one already reported for portisins, with a phenolic moiety replacing the catechin moiety. The newly formed anthocyanin-derived compounds display a bathochromic shift of the \u03bbmax (\u223c540 nm) when compared with their anthocyanin\u2212pyruvic acid adduct precursor (\u03bbmax = 511 nm), which may be due to the extended conjugation of the \u03c0 electrons in the structures of those pigments. Studies performed in model solutions helped to clarify the formation mechanism of these pigments that can result from the nucleophilic attack of the olefinic double bond of a hydroxycinnamic acid to the eletrophilic C-10 position of the anthocyanin\u2212pyruvic acid adduct, followed by the loss of a formic acid molecule and decarboxylation. The chromatic characterization of these malvidin-3-glucoside-derived compounds revealed a higher resistance to discoloration against the nucleophilic attack by water and bisulfite when compared to malvidin-3-glucoside that is almost converted into its colorless hemiacetal form. However, the resistance to discoloration of these new pigments is not as high as the one reported for catechin-derived portisins. This could be explained by the presence of a smaller group (hydroxycinnamyl group), which does not protect so efficiently the chromophore against nucleophilic attack at the C-2 position. The occurrence of these pigments in red wine highlights new chemical pathways involving anthocyanin\u2212pyruvic acid derivatives as precursors for the formation of new pigments in subsequent stages of wine aging that may contribute to its color evolution.

Energetic and Structural Determinants of Proton Mobility within Protein Ions","abstract":"The extent of internal hydrogen exchange (scrambling) within multiply charged solvent-free protein ions was investigated using a small model protein. The site-specific backbone amide protection data were obtained using protein ion fragmentation in the gas phase and compared with the available NMR data. Only minimal scrambling was detected when relatively high-energy collisional activation was used to fragment intact protein ions, while low-energy fragmentation resulted in more significant but not random internal exchange. Increased conformational flexibility of protein ions in the gas phase did not have any effect on the extent of hydrogen scrambling under the conditions of higher-energy collisional activation but resulted in totally random redistribution of labile hydrogen atoms when the protein ion fragmentation was induced by multiple low-energy collisions.

The transport behavior of \u03b3-NaAlH4, in addition to key dynamical and structural signatures, is consistent with experimental observations of high-mobility species, strongly supporting the idea that an intermediate transition from the \u03b1 phase to a high-entropy polymorph facilitates the hydrogen-releasing decomposition of NaAlH4.

It was observed that approximately one toluene molecule was adsorbed on one Na+ cation for MFI and BEA. The heat of toluene adsorption on Na+ was MOR &gt; MFI &gt; BEA &gt; FAU, similar to the heat of ammonia adsorption on the corresponding H-form zeolite. A linear relationship was observed between both adsorption heats.

Introduction of sugar or amino acid groups to the parent compound can improve the phloem mobility of insecticides, so a glycinergic\u2013fipronil conjugate (GlyF), 2-(3-(3-cyano-1-(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-4-((trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-yl)ureido) acetic acid, was designed and synthesized. Although the \u201cKleier model\u201d predicted that this conjugate is not phloem mobile, GlyF can be continually detected during a 5 h collection of Ricinus communis phloem sap. Furthermore, an R. communis seedling cotyledon disk uptake experiment demonstrates that the uptake of GlyF is sensitive to pH, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), temperature, and p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (pCMBS) and is likely mediated by amino acid carrier system. To explore the roles of amino acid transporters (AATs) in GlyF uptake, a total of 62 AAT genes were identified from the R. communis genome in silico. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AATs in R. communis were organized into the ATF (amino acid transporter) and APC (amino acid, polyaminem and choline transporter) superfamilies, with five subfamilies in ATF and two in APC. Furthermore, the expression profiles of 20 abundantly expressed AATs (cycle threshold (Ct) values &lt;27) were analyzed at 1, 3, and 6 h after GlyF treatment by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that expression levels of four AAT genes, RcLHT6, RcANT15, RcProT2, and RcCAT2, were induced by the GlyF treatment in R. communis seedlings. On the basis of the observation that the expression profile of the four candidate genes is similar to the time course observation for GlyF foliar disk uptake, it is suggested that those four genes are possible candidates involved in the uptake of GlyF. These results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of GlyF uptake as well as phloem loading from a molecular biology perspective and facilitate functional characterization of candidate AAT genes in future studies."},{"title":"Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using a DUPA\u2013Paclitaxel Conjugate","abstract":"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men in the United States and remains the second-leading cause of cancer mortality in men. Paclitaxel (PTX) is the first line chemotherapy for PCa treatment, but its therapeutic efficacy is greatly restricted by the nonspecific distribution in vivo. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed on the surface of most PCa cells, and its expression level increases with cancer aggressiveness, while being present at low levels in normal cells. The high expression level of PSMA in PCa cells offers an opportunity for target delivery of nonspecific cytotoxic drugs to PCa cells, thus improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing toxicity. PSMA has high affinity for DUPA, a glutamate urea ligand. Herein, a novel DUPA\u2013PTX conjugate is developed using DUPA as the targeting ligand to deliver PTX specifically for treatment of PSMA expressing PCa. The targeting ligand DUPA enhances the transport capability and selectivity of PTX to tumor cells via PSMA mediated endocytosis. Besides, DUPA is conjugated with PTX via a disulfide bond, which facilitates the rapid and differential drug release in tumor cells. The DUPA\u2013PTX conjugate exhibits potent cytotoxicity in PSMA expressing cell lines and induces a complete cessation of tumor growth with no obvious toxicity. Our findings give new insight into the PSMA-targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics and provide an opportunity for the development of novel active targeting drug delivery systems for PCa therapy."},{"title":"Solid Br\u00f8nsted Acid Catalysis in the Gas-Phase Esterification of Acetic Acid","abstract":"Solid acid catalysts are attractive replacements for liquid mineral acids for esterification reactions, where ester products are important for end products that are as diverse as perfumes and biofuels. Although the mechanism of homogeneous esterification has long been known, the mechanistic pathways for esterification over heterogeneous catalysts are still being pursued. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the mechanism of gas-phase esterification in the temperature range of 90\u2212140 \u00b0C for a simple carboxylic acid (acetic acid) and short-chain alcohols (methanol and ethanol) that have been catalyzed by a solid catalyst with only Br\u00f8nsted acid sites (silica-supported Nafion, SAC-13). In this study, evidence from pyridine poisoning experiments suggests that the esterification proceeds via a single site mechanism on solid Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysts such as SAC-13, as has also been concluded for reaction in the liquid phase at temperatures of \u226460 \u00b0C. Based on initial rate data for methanol reaction, the order of reaction for acetic acid shifted only from 0.7 to 0.9 as the temperature changed from 90 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C. However, the order of reaction for methanol shifted from 0.2 to \u22120.9 for the same temperature range. The results for the ethanol reaction were similar. Based on these outcomes, the reaction most probably happens between adsorbed acetic acid molecules on the active sites of the catalyst and alcohol molecules from the bulk fluid. However, as the temperature increases from 90 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C, the rate-limiting step becomes acetic acid adsorption. The reaction is also hindered by the competitive adsorption of the alcohol on the acid sites of the catalyst. Experiments that involve the preadsorption of reactants offered further evidence of the inhibiting effect of the alcohol and the change in the rate-controlling step for reaction at temperatures of &gt;100 \u00b0C.

The reductant-activated functionalization yields functional group coverages up to 70%, \u223c1.5\u20132 times higher than the previous limit, and enables functionalization by weak electrophiles, such as 1-chloropropane, that are otherwise unreactive with chemically exfoliated MoS2. We also explored the dependence of coverage on the strength of the leaving group and the steric hindrance of the alkyl halide in the absence of reductants and showed that functionalization was ineffective for chloride leaving groups and for secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides. These results demonstrate a substantial increase in coverage compared to functionalization without reductants, and may impact the performance of these materials in applications reliant on surface interactions. Furthermore, this method may be applicable to the covalent functionalization of similar layered materials and metal chalcogenides."},{"title":"High-Speed Calorimetry for the Study of the Kinetics of (De)vitrification, Crystallization, and Melting of Macromolecules\u2020","abstract":"This paper reports on the characteristics and use of a new mode of measurement:\u2009 High Performance DSC (HPer DSC), which represents a major step forward in high-speed calorimetry, as compared to standard DSC.

The major folate form in soybean identified was 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-H4folate), followed by 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate (10-CHO-PGA), and 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-H4folate), whereas folic acid was not detected and tetrahydrofolic acid (H4folate) was not detectable. The most predominant form in tempe was also 5-CHO-H4folate, followed by 10-CHO-PGA, whereas the quantities of 5-CH3-H4folate and folic acid were negligible. Quantities and retention of folate significantly decreased during the first boiling, dehulling, soaking, and second boiling procedures, yielding folate retention of 32%. A remarkable increase in folate content was found after fermentation, 5.2-fold higher than that of the boiled soybean. This may be due to de novo formation of folate by Rhizopus oligosporus, the principal mold in tempe fermentation.

But two concerns must be satisfied before it can be exploited in low-cost solution-processed organic solar cells. Fission must be combined with longer wavelength absorption in a structure that can potentially surpass the single junction limit, and its efficiency must be demonstrated in nanoscale domains within blended devices. Here, we report organic solar cells comprised of tetracene, copper phthalocyanine, and the buckyball C60. Short wavelength light generates singlet excitons in tetracene. These are subsequently split into two triplet excitons and transported through the phthalocyanine. In addition, the phthalocyanine absorbs photons below the singlet exciton energy of tetracene. To test tetracene in nanostructured blends, we fabricate coevaporated bulk heterojunctions and multilayer heterojunctions of tetracene and C60.

In this paper, a coarse-grained model for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is developed (verified against experimental data available) to simulate their interactions with model lipid membranes. Simulations reveal that AuNPs with different signs and densities of surface charges spontaneously adhere to the bilayer surface or penetrate into the bilayer interior. The potential of mean force calculations show that the energy gains upon adhesion or penetration is significant. In the case of penetration, it is found that defective areas are induced across the entire surface of the upper leaflet of the bilayer and a hydrophilic pore that transports water molecules was formed with its surrounding lipids highly disordered. Penetration and its concomitant membrane disruptions can be a possible mechanism of the two observed phenomena in experiments: AuNPs bypass endocytosis during their internalization into cells and cytotoxicity of AuNPs. It is also found that both the level of penetration and membrane disruption increase as the charge density of the AuNP increases, but in different manners. The findings suggest a way of controlling the AuNP\u2212cell interactions by manipulating surface charge densities of AuNPs to achieve designated goals in their biomedical applications, such as striking a balance between their cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in order to achieve optimal delivery efficiency as delivery agents."},{"title":"Biological Contamination of Nanoparticles and Its Manifestation in Optical Absorbance Measurements","abstract":"The biological contamination of nanomaterials is a serious problem hampering their widespread use in biomedical products.

During the operation of the fuel cell, noble metal catalysts are widely used to accelerate the reaction kinetics by alloying with other materials. However, there are a few facile methods for improving elemental metal catalytic activity. In this work, the defect-rich palladium (Pd) aerogels are acquired by laser ablating technology, which can significantly improve the intrinsic activity of Pd elementary catalysts through introducing defects and lattice strain. The electrochemical results show that the mass and specific activities of the obtained Pd aerogel for the formate oxidation reaction are 2.26 and 1.99 times higher than those of the commercial Pd\/C. The excellent activity and stability of the Pd aerogel for ethanol oxidation reaction have also been demonstrated. The effect of the compressive strain is further investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The drug release profiles were simulated using two color dyes (KAB, keyacid blue; KAU, keyacid uranine), whose release in physiological solution was measured using optical absorption as a function of time. To reach the level of 80% release of encapsulated dye from core, triaxial fibers with a PCL intermediate layer exhibited a \u223c24\u00d7 slower release than that from coaxial fibers. At the same time, the hygroscopic sheath layer of the triaxial fibers provided an initial burst release (\u223c 80% within an hour) of a second dye as high as that from conventional single and coaxial fibers. The triaxial fiber membrane provides both a quick release from the outer sheath layer for short-term treatment and a sustained release from the fiber core for long-term treatment. The intermediate layer between inner core and outer sheath acts as a barrier to prevent leaching from the core, which can be especially important when the membranes are used in wet application.

Both enzymes have low KM values for their substrates. Kinetic assays for these enzymes are challenging, as the ultraviolet absorbance spectra for reactant MTA and product adenine are similar. We report a new assay using 2-amino-5\u2032-methylthioadenosine (2AMTA) as an alternative substrate for MTAP and MTAN enzymes. Hydrolysis or phosphorolysis of 2AMTA forms 2,6-diaminopurine, a fluorescent and easily quantitated product. We kinetically characterize 2AMTA with human MTAP, bacterial MTANs and use 2,6-diaminopurine as a fluorescent substrate for yeast adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. 2AMTA was used as the substrate to kinetically characterize the dissociation constants for three-transition-state analogue inhibitors of MTAP and MTAN. Kinetic values obtained from continuous fluorescent assays with MTA were in good agreement with previously measured literature values, but gave smaller experimental errors. Chemical synthesis from ribose and 2,6-dichloropurine provided crystalline 2AMTA as the oxalate salt. Chemo-enzymatic synthesis from ribose and 2,6-diaminopurine produced 2-amino-S-adenosylmethionine for hydrolytic conversion to 2AMTA. Interaction of 2AMTA with human MTAP was also characterized by pre-steady-state kinetics and by analysis of the crystal structure in a complex with sulfate as a catalytically inert analogue of phosphate.

The building block of the supercells is a 100\u2013120 nm wide and 175 nm tall silicon nanowire that shows a strong Mie resonance around \u03bb = 650 nm. By arranging the resonant Mie scatterers into metagratings of increasing pitch (675\u20131300 nm), we created a Lambertian-like scattering distribution over an angular range of choice. The millimeter-sized metasurfaces were fabricated using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. The fabricated metasurface nearly fully suppresses specular reflection on resonance while 10% of the incoming light around the resonance is scattered into the angular range between 30\u00b0 and 75\u00b0, creating a bright red appearance over this specific range of angles. Off-resonant light in the blue, green, and near-infrared is efficiently transmitted through the metasurface and absorbed in the underlying photovoltaic cell. The implemented silicon heterojunction solar cells with integrated metagrating supercells shows a reduction in external quantum efficiency matching the resonant scattering spectral range. The short circuit current is reduced by 13% due to the combined effects of resonant scattering, reflection from the high-index substrate, and absorption in the Si nanowires.

In this study, we performed qualitative and quantitative analyses to globally identify lysine malonylation substrates in Escherichia coli. We identified 1745 malonylation sites in 594 proteins in E.\u00a0coli, representing the first and largest malonylome data set in prokaryotes up to date. Bioinformatic analyses showed that lysine malonylation was significantly enriched in protein translation, energy metabolism pathways and fatty acid biosynthesis, implying the potential roles of protein malonylation in bacterial physiology. Quantitative proteomics by fatty acid synthase inhibition in both auxotrophic and prototrophic E.\u00a0coli strains revealed that lysine malonylation is closely associated with E.\u00a0coli fatty acid metabolism. Protein structural analysis and mutagenesis experiment suggested malonylation could impact enzymatic activity of citrate synthase, a key enzyme in citric acid (TCA) cycle. Further comparative analysis among lysine malonylome, succinylome and acetylome data showed that these three modifications could participate in some similar enriched metabolism pathways, but they could also possibly play distinct roles such as in fatty acid synthesis.

Gelation times range from 5 &lt; tc \u2264 45 min, with the fastest kinetics occurring for the highest HMWH maleimide functionalities. tc depends nonmonotonically on the PEG cross-linker molecular weight, suggesting that gelation is affected by the length of the cross-linker relative to intermolecular interactions between heparin molecules. The critical relaxation exponent decreases from n = 0.52 for PEG 2000 to n = 0.39 for PEG 10\u2009000.

These pyramids contain at least four different orientations which share a common (100)-plane, indicating mechanical twinning. The crystal orientation of each twin changes during growth along the surface. Kinetic selection was observed during crystal growth into the bulk which does not occur in the form of solid crystal bodies. A glass skin covering the crystals was not detected."},{"title":"Measurement and Correlation of the Thermal Conductivity of <i>trans<\/i>-1-Chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (R1233zd(E))","abstract":"New experimental data on the thermal conductivity of trans-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (R1233zd(E)) are reported that allow the development of wide-range correlations. These new experimental data, covering a temperature range of 204 to 453 K at pressures from 0.1 to 67 MPa, are used to develop a correlation for the thermal conductivity. The experimental data reported here have an uncertainty of 1% for liquid and supercritical (density &gt; 700 kg\u00b7m\u20133), 1.5% for vapor and supercritical (pressure \u2265 1 MPa and density &lt; 200 kg\u00b7m\u20133), 3% for supercritical (200 kg\u00b7m\u20133 \u2264 density \u2264 700 kg\u00b7m\u20133), and 3% vapor and supercritical (pressure &lt;1 MPa).

We observed electric field induced wetting of a hydrophobic gate in a biologically inspired model nanopore based on the 5-HT3 receptor in its closed state, with a field of at least \u223c100 mV nm\u20131 (corresponding to a supra-physiological potential difference of \u223c0.85 V across the membrane) required to hydrate the pore. We also found an unequal distribution of charged residues can generate an electric field intrinsic to the nanopore which, depending on its orientation, can alter the effect of the external field, thus making the wetting response asymmetric. This wetting response could be described by a simple model based on water surface tension, the volumetric energy contribution of the electric field, and the influence of charged amino acids lining the pore. Finally, the electric field response was used to determine time constants characterizing the phase transitions of water confined within the nanopore, revealing liquid\u2013vapor oscillations on a time scale of \u223c5 ns. This time scale was largely independent of the water model employed and was similar for different sized pores representative of the open and closed states of the pore. Furthermore, our finding that the threshold voltage required for hydrating a hydrophobic gate depends on the orientation of the electric field provides an attractive perspective for the design of rectifying artificial nanopores."},{"title":"Polarizability Fields for Use in Three-Dimensional Quantitative Structure\u2212Activity Relationship (3D-QSAR)","abstract":"Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), a three-dimensional quantitative structure\u2212activity relationship (3D-QSAR) technique, has proven to be a valuable tool in the field of rational drug design. In its native form, CoMFA utilizes a pseudoreceptor, in the form of a regularly spaced lattice of probe atoms, to characterize the steric and electrostatic properties of a series of mutually superimposed molecules. Statistical analyses are performed in an attempt to correlate changes in these shape and charge related fields to observed differences in biological activities at a given target. Graphical analyses of the resulting \u201cnegative receptor images\u201d have been demonstrated to provide insight into the physicochemical requirements of novel ligands. Several groups have previously demonstrated the benefits of additional or alternative fields for these types of analyses. In this report, a novel molecular potential field derived from atomistic contributions to molecular polarizability is presented. Comparison studies will be presented using literature data sets and CoMFA models derived from steric, electrostatic, and polarizability fields. The overall conclusion is that molecular polarizability fields derived from semiempirically determined atomic polarizabilities are highly predictive and graphically descriptive supplements to, and perhaps surrogates for, the standard CoMFA steric and electrostatic fields.

Before nanosheet stacking, Pt(terpy) was immobilized at the edge of the titanate nanosheets. The visible-light-induced vectorial Z-scheme electron transfer reaction from the valence band of tungstate to the conduction band of titanate via the photoexcited Ru(bpy)32+ was demonstrated by the following two evidences: (1) From the results of the fluorescence decay of Ru(bpy)32+, the rate of the forward electron transfer from the photoexcited Ru(bpy)32+ to the conduction band of titanate was estimated as 1.16 \u00d7 108 s\u20131, which was 10 times faster than the backward electron transfer from the photoexcited Ru(bpy)3 to the conduction band of tungstate (1.02 \u00d7 107 s\u20131) due to a localization of Ru(bpy)32+ on the titanate nanosheets. (2) We observed the decrease of the electrons accumulated in the conduction band of the tungstate induced by photoexcitation of Ru(bpy)32+, demonstrating the forward electron transfer from the conduction band of tugnstate to the vacant highest occupied molecular orbital level of the photoexcitation Ru(bpy)32+. Finally, H2 gas was produced from the water dispersion of the alternate-layered structure under visible light irradiation, suggesting that the electrons getting to the conduction band of the titanate were transferred to the Pt(terpy) placed at the edge of the nanosheets, and reduced water to dihydrogen. Herein, n-octylamine species at the interlayer space played a role as hole scavenger; in other words, these molecules were oxidized by the hole in the conduction band of the tungstate nanosheets."},{"title":"Complex Effects of 24:1 Sphingolipids in Membranes Containing Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and Cholesterol","abstract":"The effects of C24:1 sphingolipids have been tested in phospholipid bilayers containing cholesterol. Confocal microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and atomic force microscopy imaging and force curves have been used. More precisely, the effects of C24:1 ceramide (nervonoyl ceramide, nCer) were evaluated and compared to those of C16:0 ceramide (palmitoyl ceramide, pCer) in bilayers composed basically of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin (either C24:1, nSM or C16:0, pSM) and cholesterol. Combination of equimolecular amounts of C24:1 and C16:0 sphingolipids were also studied under the same conditions. Results show that both pCer and nCer are capable of forming segregated gel domains. Force spectroscopy data point to nCer having a lower stiffening effect than pCer, while the presence of nSM reduces the stiffness. DSC reveals Tm reduction by nSM in every case. Furthermore, pSM seems to better accommodate both ceramides in a single phase of intermediate properties, while nSM partial accommodation of ceramides generates different gel phases with higher stiffnesses caused by interceramide cooperation. If both pSM and nSM are present, a clear preference of both ceramides toward pSM is observed. These findings show the sharp increase in complexity when membranes exhibit different sphingolipids of varying N-acyl chains, which should be a common issue in an actual cell membrane environment."},{"title":"Venom Profiling of the Insular Species <i>Bothrops alcatraz<\/i>: Characterization of Proteome, Glycoproteome, and N-Terminome Using Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates","abstract":"Bothrops alcatraz, a species endemic to Alcatrazes Islands, is regarded as critically endangered due to its small area of occurrence and the declining quality of its habitat. We recently reported the identification of N-glycans attached to toxins of Bothrops species, showing similar compositions in venoms of the B. jararaca complex (B. jararaca, B. insularis, and B. alcatraz). Here, we characterized B. alcatraz venom using electrophoretic, proteomic, and glycoproteomic approaches. Electrophoresis showed that B. alcatraz venom differs from B. jararaca and B. insularis; however, N-glycan removal revealed similarities between them, indicating that the occupation of N-glycosylation sites contributes to interspecies variability in the B. jararaca complex. Metalloproteinase was the major toxin class identified in the B. alcatraz venom proteome followed by serine proteinase and C-type lectin, and overall, the adult B. alcatraz venom resembles that of B. jararaca juvenile specimens. The comparative glycoproteomic analysis of B. alcatraz venom with B. jararaca and B. insularis indicated that there may be differences in the utilization of N-glycosylation motifs among their different toxin classes. Furthermore, we prospected for the first time the N-terminome of a snake venom using the terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) approach and report the presence of \u223c30% of N-termini corresponding to truncated toxin forms and \u223c37% N-terminal sequences blocked by pyroglutamic acid in B. alcatraz venom.

The double-doped sample allows a greater doping amount than any single doping, with significantly smaller nanostrain on the c axis, and shows superior superconducting properties. By analyzing the crystal mismatch and establishing a suitable model of the doping effects, it was found that the double doping with the positive mismatch and the negative mismatch dopant cancels the long-range strain but still generates defects around the interface between the YBCO and the dopants, simultaneously. This result reveals a feasible method for solving the problem of degradation and even cracks in the YBCO film due to the excess doping amount. This approach provides a wider compositional space for the design and fabrication of more ingenious pinning structures in the YBCO film for meeting the criteria of specific applications."},{"title":"Stabilized Polymers with Novel Indenoindene Backbone against Photodegradation for LEDs and Solar Cells","abstract":"PPV derivatives, polymers with vinylene units, have their tendency to exhibit degradation, after irradiation with white light or operation of the device, resulting in the appearance of a shifted absorption and emission band in the short wavelength regions of the spectra.

PININE copolymers with benzothiadiazole and thiophene units exhibit high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for polymer solar cells. Under white light illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW\/cm2), the cell based on PININEDTBT\/PCBM as the active layer has a short circuit current density (Isc) of 5.93 mA\/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 43%, and PCE of 1.88%.

Heterotrophic bacteria play a dominant role in the CABR process, and their reactivity is seriously affected by carbon source and electron donor. Therefore, the consumption and utilization pathways of glucose were investigated. The study on glucose metabolites shows that the accumulation of acetate should be alleviated, which make it possible to keep running the bioreactor normally, although the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) may be beneficial as an electron donor for the reactions in CABR. The reduction of complex NO mainly depends upon the concentration of Fe(II) and acetate.

The steric clash between the central methylene of the propanedithiolate and the phosphine favors the rotated structure, which forms upon oxidation. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra for the mixed-valence cations indicate that the unpaired electron is localized on the Fe(CO)(dppv) center in both [Fe2(S2C3H6)(CO)4(dppv)]BF4 and [Fe2(S2C3H6)(CO)3(PMe3)(dppv)]BF4, as seen previously for the ethanedithiolate [Fe2(S2C2H4)(CO)3(PMe3)(dppv)]BF4. For [Fe2(S2CnH2n)(CO)3(Pi-Pr3)(dppv)]BF4; however, the spin is localized on the Fe(CO)2(Pi-Pr3) center, although the Fe(CO)(dppv) site is rotated in the crystalline state. IR and EPR spectra, as well as redox potentials and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggest that the Fe(CO)2(Pi-Pr3) site is rotated in solution, driven by steric factors. Analysis of the DFT-computed partial atomic charges for the mixed-valence species shows that the Fe atom featuring a vacant apical coordination position is an electrophilic Fe(I) center.

The capillary number, the fluid flow rate ratio, and the viscosity ratio were changed systematically, while all other parameters were kept constant. The flow mechanisms at the microscopic and macroscopic scales were examined visually and videorecorded. As in the case of intermediate wettability, we observed that over a broad range of values of the system parameters the pore-scale flow mechanisms include many strongly nonlinear phenomena, specifically, breakup, coalescence, stranding, mobilization, etc. Such microscopically irreversible phenomena cause macroscopic nonlinearity and irreversibility, which make an Onsager-type theory inappropriate for this class of flows. The main effects of strong wettability are that it changes the domains of the system parameter values where the various flow regimes are observed and increases the relative permeability values, whereas the qualitative aspects of the flow remain the same. Currently, a new true-to-mechanism model is being developed for this class of flows.

These enzymes share the same Fe coordination, only differing by the axial ligation, e.g., Cys in P450 oxygenases, Tyr in catalases, and His in peroxidases. By examining \u223c200 heme-iron proteins, we show that the protein hosts exert highly specific intramolecular electric fields on the active sites, and there is a strong correlation between the direction and magnitude of this field and the protein function. In all heme proteins, the field is preferentially aligned with the Fe\u2013O bond (Fz). The Cys-ligated P450 oxygenases have the highest average Fz of 28.5 MV cm\u20131, i.e., most enhancing the oxyl-radical character of the oxo group, and consistent with the ability of these proteins to activate strong C\u2013H bonds. In contrast, in Tyr-ligated proteins, the average Fz is only 3.0 MV cm\u20131, apparently suppressing single-electron off-pathway oxidations, and in His-ligated proteins, Fz is \u22128.7 MV cm\u20131. The operational field range is given by the trade-off between the low reactivity of the FeIVO compound I at the more negative Fz and the low selectivity at the more positive Fz. Consequently, a heme-iron site placed in the field characteristic of another heme-iron protein class loses its canonical function and gains an adverse one. Thus, electric fields produced by the protein scaffolds, together with the nature of the axial ligand, control all heme-iron chemistry."},{"title":"Control of Nucleation in Solution Growth of Anatase TiO<sub>2<\/sub> on Glass Substrate","abstract":"Low-temperature preparation of ceramic thin films in aqueous solution is an important new field in the synthesis of functional materials. This work examines control of nucleation in the growth of anatase titania (TiO2) on a common glass substrate at 55\u221280 \u00b0C using an inorganic precursor, TiF4. It is found that TiO2 on fused silica is first formed as single-crystalline nuclei during an initial heterogeneous nucleation. These TiO2 crystallites elongate along the [001] direction with their [110] axis perpendicular to the glass substrate; the elongated nuclei later grew into a round flowerlike morphology owing to a significant increase in homogeneous nucleation rate during the continued growth. The flowerlike polycrystalline TiO2 islands, either as discrete crystallites or as lined crystallite arrays, subsequently develop into a planar crystallite monolayer. In general, low-pH condition suppresses heterogeneous nucleation and growth; this allows a self-alignment of thin threadlike crystallites. In contrast, higher pH favors the heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent planar growth but results in polydispersivity of crystallites. All of these observations can be related to the hydrolysis of TiF4 and formation of Si\u2212O\u2212Ti and Ti\u2212O\u2212Ti linkages. In particular, localized HF concentration enrichment resulting from the TiF4 hydrolysis is responsible for the sequential lined crystallite formation and planar-branching, as well as creation of unsaturated surface bonds of fused glass for heterogeneous nucleation. High nucleation densities have been achieved by mechanical and chemical treatments, and nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films have been prepared using etched substrates.

The influence of the length of both the thermoresponsive and the hydrophilic block on the size and conformation of single molecules at various temperatures was studied by means of simulations. The temperature-induced contraction of the copolymer (MPEGn-b-PNIPAAM71) entities is only modestly affected by changing the length of the hydrophilic block, whereas for the MPEG57-b-PNIPAAMm copolymer both the transition temperature and the magnitude of the compression of the molecules are strongly influenced by the length of the thermosensitive block.

We observe that the macrocycle can efficiently and selectively bind Cl\u2013 ion and transport Cl\u2013 ion across a lipid bilayer. 1H NMR anion binding studies suggest a coherent relationship between the acidity of aminoxy amide N\u2013H and triazole C\u2013H proton binding strength.

Persistent efforts continue to achieve efficient light emission from silicon in extending the silicon technology into fully integrated optoelectronic circuits. Here, we report the realization of room-temperature stimulated emission in the technologically crucial 1.5 \u03bcm wavelength range from Er-doped GaN multiple-quantum wells on silicon and sapphire. Employing the well-acknowledged variable stripe technique, we have demonstrated an optical gain up to 170 cm\u20131 in the multiple-quantum well structures. The observation of the stimulated emission is accompanied by the characteristic threshold behavior of emission intensity as a function of pump fluence, spectral line width narrowing, and excitation length. The demonstration of room-temperature lasing at the minimum loss window of optical fibers and in the eye-safe wavelength region of 1.5 \u03bcm are highly sought after for use in many applications including defense, industrial processing, communication, medicine, spectroscopy, and imaging. As the synthesis of Er-doped GaN epitaxial layers on silicon and sapphire has been successfully demonstrated, the results laid the foundation for achieving hybrid GaN-Si lasers, providing a new pathway toward full photonic integration for silicon optoelectronics."},{"title":"Effect of Nanometric-Scale Roughness on Slip at the Wall of Simple Fluids","abstract":"It is commonly acknowledged that roughness decreases the aptitude of simple liquids to exhibit flow with slip at solid interfaces. Most available studies have, however, been conducted on substrates for which both the surface chemistry and the roughness were varied simultaneously, making it difficult to identify their respective role on wall slip. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a series of surfaces formed by grafting hyperbranched polymeric nanoparticles on a smooth, dense, self-assembled monolayer of SiH-terminated short poly(dimethylsiloxane) oligomers, allowing us to vary independently the surface density, the height, and the width of the grafted nanoparticles, and thereby the roughness parameters, while keeping similar surface chemistry. On such substrates, the boundary condition for the flow velocity of hexadecane has been characterized through near-field laser velocimetry. We demonstrate that decreasing the wavelength of the roughness at a fixed height strongly decreases slip, while increasing the height of the nanoparticles at a fixed aspect ratio of the roughness also dramatically affects slippage.

We developed a wet-spinning assmebly strategy to achieve continuous all-inorganic fibers of montmorillonite (MMT) nanoplatelets by incorporation of a graphene oxide (GO) liquid crystal (LC) template at a rate of 9 cm\/s, and the templating role of GO LC is confirmed by in situ confocal laser scanning microscopy and polarized optical microscopy inspections. After protofibers underwent thermal reduction, the obtained binary complex fibers composed of neat 2D crystals integrate the outstanding fire-retardance of MMT nanoplatelets and the excellent conductivity of graphene nanosheets. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscope observations reveal the microstructures of fibers with compactly stacking layers. MMT-graphene fibers show increaing tensile strengths (88\u2013270 MPa) and electrical conductivities (130\u201310500 S\/m) with increasing graphene fraction. MMT-graphene (10\/90) fibers are used as fire-resistant (bearing temperature in air: 600\u2013700 \u00b0C), lightweight (\u03c1 &lt; 1.62 g\/cm3) conductors (conductivity: up to 1.04 \u00d7 104 S\/m) in view of their superior performance in high-temperature air beyond commercial T700 carbon fibers. We attribute the fire-resistance of MMT-graphene fibers to the armor-like protection of MMT layers, which could shield graphene layers from the action of oxidative etching. The composite fibers worked well as fire-resistant conductors when being heated to glowing red by an alcohol lamp. Our GO LC-templating wet-spinning strategy may also inspire the continuous assembly of other layered crystals into high-performance composite fibers."},{"title":"Review on Ammonia Absorption Materials: Metal Hydrides, Halides, and Borohydrides","abstract":"Ammonia is well-known as a hydrogen carrier owing to its high hydrogen capacity (17.8 wt %). However, the toxicity and the high storage pressure limit the application of ammonia. Consequently, storing ammonia in solid state has become the promising method to utilize ammonia for practical applications. In this review, ammonia absorption properties of metal hydrides, halides, and borohydrides to form metal amides and metal ammine complexes with various coordination numbers have been systematically summarized. Through this research, we found the correlation between the reactivity with ammonia and the Pauling electronegativity of neutral atoms according to different systems. Metal hydrides with small electronegativity value of the neutral atom of the cations can react with ammonia to form metal amides, which can be used as hydrogen storage material. For metal halides or borohydrides, the lower plateau pressure of ammonia absorption can be obtained in the material with larger electronegativity value of the neutral atom of cations. This useful tendency can be used in the materials design for the potential applications of ammonia-fed fuel cells."},{"title":"One-Step Facile Synthesis of Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Dots: A Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Evaluation of Acetylcholinesterase Activity and Detection of Organophosphorus Pesticides in Tap Water and Food","abstract":"Evaluation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and determination of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are of great importance for the clinical diagnosis of several serious diseases correlated with their variations in human blood serum. In this study, a highly selective and sensitive ratiometric fluorescent probe was innovatively fabricated for the evaluation of AChE activity and the determination of OPs in tap water and food on the basis of the inner filter effect (IFE) between nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) and 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). N-CDs were synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method by using pancreatin and 1,2-ethanediamine as precursors. N-CDs showed excellent fluorescence properties and negligible cytotoxicity on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells, suggesting their further biological applications. Upon the addition of AChE and choline oxidase, acetylcholine was catalyzed to produce choline that was further oxidized to produce H2O2. In the presence of horseradish peroxidase, o-phenylenediamine reacted with H2O2 to produce fluorescent DAP. Therefore, a ratiometric fluorescent probing platform existed via IFE between N-CDs with a fluorescence signal at 450 nm and DAP with a fluorescence signal at 574 nm. OPs irreversibly impeded the catalytic activity of AChE, finally leading to the decrease of DAP amount and the variation of ratiometric fluorescent signal. Under optimal conditions, such a fluorescent probe showed relatively low detection limits of 0.38 U\/L for AChE, 3.2 ppb for dichlorvos, and 13 ppb for methyl-parathion. Practical application of this ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect OPs was further verified in tap water and food samples with satisfying results that were highly consisted with the results obtained by GC\u2013MS."},{"title":"Melting and Freezing of Au Nanoparticles Confined in Armchair Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes","abstract":"The structure, phase transition, and nucleation of Au nanoparticles confined within armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes ((n,n)-SWNTs) are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique. The Au\u2212Au interactions are described by the TB-SMA potentials and the Au-SWNT interactions are represented by Lennard-Jones potential. SWNTs are approximately considered to be rigid. The total energies, structures, Lindemman indices, and radial density distributions are used to reveal the feature of phase transition for Au nanoparticles confined in (n,n)-SWNTs. The classical nucleation theory is applied to perform nucleation analysis. Results demonstrate that confined AuN exhibit multishell structures. The order\u2212disorder transformation of atoms in each layer is an important structure feature of phase transition. Interestingly, the melting starts from the innermost layer and freezing starts from outermost layer for confined Au nanoparticles. SWNTs have a significant effect on the structures and stabilities of the confined Au nanoparticles. On the other hand, some important thermodynamic and dynamic parameters are estimated and compared with available experimental and calculated results. This work provides the primary physical insights into the phase transition and nucleation process of confined Au nanoparticles."},{"title":"Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropane Amino Acids Using Diazo Compounds Generated in Situ","abstract":"A simple and high-yielding method for the preparation of cyclopropane amino acids is described.

Validations of chemical kinetic models were made using available chemical kinetic models. A modified chemical model (Mod Mech C5) was proposed, and it can predict well the experimental ignition delay times and activation energies of pure propane, pure DME, and their blends. Both experimental and numerical results show that, with the decrease of the temperature, the logarithmic ignition delay time is increased linearly and activation energy is decreased slightly. With the increase of the equivalence ratio, the ignition delay time is increased for propane but decreased for DME. The ignition delay time is decreased with the increase of the DME blending ratio, and the reduction rate is increased with an increase in the equivalence ratio. Sensitivity analysis and radical pool analysis were performed to interpret the promoting effect of DME addition on the ignition of DME\/propane mixtures."},{"title":"Antineoplastic Agents. 607.

The catecholic primers with different polymerizable end groups were designed and then coated on glass surfaces using a simple drop-casting or dip-coating process. The surface binding ability and possible cross-linking (coupling or chemical bridging between the glass substrate and the dental resin) of the catecholic bifunctional primers were evaluated using atomic force microscopy, contact angle measurements, and the knife shear bonding test and compared to a state-of-the-art silane-based coupling agent. Various mechanical tests including shrinkage and compression tests of the dental resin composites were also conducted. Compression tests of the composites containing the catecholic primed fillers exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, owing to the bidentate hydrogen bonding of catechol moieties to the oxide mineral surface.

To obtain detailed knowledge of the evolution of hydrolytic enzyme activities in PHS wheat (Triticum aestivum), a broad collection of samples from three varieties was obtained by harvesting before, at, and after maturity. Delaying harvest time coupled with periods of heavy rainfall caused sprouting in the kernels, observed as a drop in Falling Number and an increase in \u03b1-amylase activity. The appearance of \u03b1- and \u03b2-amylase, peptidase, and endoxylanase activity during field sprouting was independent from each other. Consequently, Falling Number could not be used to predict activity of other hydrolytic enzymes. When differentiating endogenous from kernel-associated microbial enzymes, results showed that \u03b1- and \u03b2-amylase and peptidase activity of PHS kernels were predominantly of endogenous origin, whereas endoxylanase activity was largely from microbial origin."},{"title":"Band Effects on Stimulated Desorption of F<sup>+<\/sup> from CaF<sub>2<\/sub> and Fluorinated TiC(111) Surfaces","abstract":"The mechanism of stimulated F+ desorption has been investigated from fluorinated TiC(111) and CaF2 surfaces by He+, Ne+, Ar+, H+, and D+ irradiation. Upon He+ irradiation, the F+ ion is ejected from the surface of CaF2 via both kinetic and potential sputtering, whereas the potential sputtering of F+ is dominant from the fluorinated TiC(111) surface. The kinetically sputtered F+ ion from the metal surface undergoes efficient resonant neutralization due to the band effect. The probability for potential sputtering of F+ from the F\/TiC(111) surface is dependent upon the primary ion species on the order of He+ &gt; Ne+ \u226b Ar+. The F+ desorption is not simply related to the ionization potential of the projectile as evidenced by the fact that H+, though having the ionization potential smaller than Ar+ induces F+ emission with the yield about 70 times as large as that by Ar+ and almost one-fourth that by He+. The comparison between H+ and D+ irradiations clearly shows that the swifter ion leads to a higher F+ emission probability. From these facts, it is concluded that the F+ emission is initiated by formation of the F 2s core\u2212hole state having the antibonding character as a consequence of the nonadiabatic transition of the primary ion's hole during collision. The ionization of the core-excited fluorine occurs due to the intra-atomic Auger decay (autoionization) after breakage of the chemisorptive bond, so that the resulting F+ ion can avoid efficient reneutralization even at metal surfaces.

The sulfur K-edge XAS spectrum of washed blood cell membranes revealed traces of sulfate and low-valent sulfur, but no sulfate ester or sulfonate. Sulfonate is thus exclusively cytosolic. Cell-free blood plasma contains primarily sulfate sulfur. Gaussian fitting and sulfate quantitation for two whole blood cell samples, each representing dozens of individuals from separate collections taken per annum, yielded average sulfur type concentrations for the two populations:\u2009 (first year, second year):\u2009 [sulfate], 110 mM, 150 mM; [sulfonate], 99 mM, 70 mM, and; [low-valent sulfur], 41 mM, 220 mM.

Partial hydrogenation of phenyl ring reduces the barrier of deoxygenation. The intermediate formed by adding 5 H atoms to the phenyl ring and with \u03b1-C adsorption on Pt is identified as the key intermediate responsible for the formation of different products with mild barriers: deprotonating the hydroxyl to cyclohexanone at 0.38 eV, hydrogenation at \u03b1-C to cyclohexanol at 0.56 eV, and deoxygenation at 0.76 eV followed by dehydrogenation to benzene. Microkinetic parameter analysis indicates that the hydrogenation steps are fast and reversible while deoxygenation steps are slow and almost irreversible, which is consistent with the experimental observation that hydrogenation products are the major primary products at low conversions while deoxygenation product dominates at high conversions, at 523 K and ambient H2 pressure.

Herein, we report on strategies to obtain tunable well-defined supramolecular architectures of an organic\u2013inorganic heterogeneous hybrid catalyst formed by the association of a hydrophobically substituted polyampholyte copolymer (poly N, N-diallyl-N-hexylamine-alt-maleic acid) and phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) POMs. The self-assembling property of the initial polyampholyte copolymer matrix is modulated by controlling the pH of the hybridization solution. When deposited on a mica surface, isolated, long and extended polymer chains are formed under basic conditions (pH 7.9), while globular or coiled structures are formed under acidic conditions (pH 2). The supramolecular assembly of the POM-polymer hybrid is found to be directed by the type and quantities of charges present on the polyampholyte copolymer, which themselves depend on the pH conditions. The hypothesis is that the Keggin type [PW12O40]3\u2013 anions, which have a size of \u223c1 nm, electrostatically bind to the positive charge sites of the polymer backbone. The hybrid material stabilized at pH 5.3 consists of POM-decorated polymer chains. Statistical analysis of distances between pairs of POM entities show narrow density distributions, suggesting that POM entities are attached to the polymer chains with a high level of order. Conversely, under acidic conditions (pH 2), the hybrid shows the formation of a core\u2013shell type of structure. The strategies reported here, to tune the supramolecular assembly of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials, are highly valuable for the design and a more rational utilization of POM heterogeneous catalysts in several chemical transformations."},{"title":"SrTiO<sub>3<\/sub>\/Epoxy Nanodielectrics as Bulk Energy Storage and Harvesting Systems: The Role of Conductivity","abstract":"Composite nanodielectric materials with strontium titanate nanoparticles embedded within an epoxy resin matrix were prepared and studied, varying the filler content. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy was employed for determining the dielectric response of the prepared specimens. Dielectric results reveal the presence of three relaxations processes, which are attributed to (a) glass to rubber transition of the polymer matrix (\u03b1-mode), (b) rearrangement of polar side groups (\u03b2-mode), and (c) interfacial polarization between systems\u2019 constituents. The stored and harvested energy of the examined nanodielectrics was also evaluated under DC conditions in the applied voltage range of 10\u2013240 V. The coefficient of energy efficiency (neff) was determined for all filler\u2019s content, varying the applied temperature and field. The effect of temperature appears to be pronounced, causing a sigmoidal dependence of neff. Furthermore, filler content enhances neff, reaching the highest value of 69.41% for the 10 phr SrTiO3 nanocomposite at 50 V. Finally, both AC and DC conductivities were evaluated as a function of filler and temperature, and the corresponding activation energies were calculated. Hopping conductivity appears to be the predominant conduction mechanism in all nanocomposite systems, since experimental data are in accordance with variable range hopping model."},{"title":"Effects of Macromolecular Crowding on Amyloid Beta (16\u201322) Aggregation Using Coarse-Grained Simulations","abstract":"To examine the effect of crowding on protein aggregation, discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations combined with an intermediate resolution protein model, PRIME20, were applied to a peptide\/crowder system. The systems contained 192 A\u03b2(16\u201322) peptides and crowders of diameters 5, 20, and 40 \u00c5, represented here by simple hard spheres, at crowder volume fractions of 0.00, 0.10, and 0.20. Results show that both crowder volume fraction and crowder diameter have a large impact on fibril and oligomer formation. The addition of crowders to a system of peptides increases the rate of oligomer formation, shifting from a slow ordered formation of oligomers in the absence of crowders, similar to nucleated polymerization, to a fast collapse of peptides and subsequent rearrangement characteristic of nucleated conformational conversion with a high maximum in the number of peptides in oligomers as the total crowder surface area increases. The rate of conversion from oligomers to fibrils also increases with increasing total crowder surface area, giving rise to an increased rate of fibril growth. In all cases, larger volume fractions and smaller crowders provide the greatest aggregation enhancement effects. We also show that the size of the crowders influences the formation of specific oligomer sizes. In our simulations, the 40 \u00c5 crowders enhance the number of dimers relative to the numbers of trimers, hexamers, pentamers, and hexamers, while the 5 \u00c5 crowders enhance the number of hexamers relative to the numbers of dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. These results are in qualitative agreement with previous experimental and theoretical work."},{"title":"\u201cLiving\u201d Cationic Polymerization of Phosphoranimines as an Ambient Temperature Route to Polyphosphazenes with Controlled Molecular Weights","abstract":"A new method for the synthesis of poly(dichlorophosphazene) at ambient temperatures is described. It involves the initiation of Cl3PNSiMe3 with small amounts of PCl5 in CH2Cl2 to yield poly(dichlorophosphazene), (NPCl2)n, with narrow polydispersities. The molecular weight of poly(dichlorophosphazene) was controlled by altering the ratio of monomer to initiator. The polymer chains were found to be active after chain propagation since further addition of monomer resulted in the formation of higher molecular weight polymer. Integration of 1H and 31P NMR spectra of these reactions revealed that the polymerization follows first-order reaction kinetics with respect to monomer concentration. Active polymer chains may be quenched or end-capped by the addition of trace quantities of Me2(CF3CH2O)PNSiMe3 or (CF3CH2O)3PNSiMe3. Furthermore, PBr5, SbCl5, and Ph3C[PF6] were also found to be effective initiators in CH2Cl2 at room temperature.

We previously found that the analysis of translating mRNA (mRNA attached to ribosome-nascent chain complex, RNC-mRNA) can explain over 94% of mRNA-protein abundance. Therefore, we propose here to use full-length RNC-mRNA information to illustrate protein expression both qualitatively and quantitatively. We performed RNA-seq on RNC-mRNA (RNC-seq) and detected 12\u2009758 and 14\u2009113 translating genes in human normal bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, respectively. We found that most of these genes were mapped with &gt;80% of coding sequence coverage. In Caco-2 cells, we provided translating evidence on 4180 significant single-nucleotide variations. While using RNC-mRNA data as a standard for proteomic data integration, both translating and protein evidence of 7876 genes can be acquired from four interlaboratory data sets with different MS platforms. In addition, we detected 1397 noncoding mRNAs that were attached to ribosomes, suggesting a potential source of new protein explorations. By comparing the two cell lines, a total of 677 differentially translated genes were found to be nonevenly distributed across chromosomes. In addition, 2105 genes in Caco-2 and 750 genes in HBE cells are expressed in a cell-specific manner. These genes are significantly and specifically clustered on multiple chromosomes, such as chromosome 19. We conclude that HPP\/C-HPP investigations can be considerably improved by integrating RNC-mRNA analysis with MS, bioinformatics, and antibody-based verifications."},{"title":"Synthesis, Structures, Magnetic Properties, and Absorption Spectra of the Alkaline Oxocobaltates(II):\u2009 Li<sub>6<\/sub>CoO<sub>4<\/sub>, Na<sub>4<\/sub>CoO<sub>3<\/sub>, and Na<sub>10<\/sub>Co<sub>4<\/sub>O<sub>9<\/sub>","abstract":"The synthesis of Li6CoO4, Na4CoO3, and Na10Co4O9 and the refinements of the crystal structures of the two sodium compounds are reported.

BPs were extracted by NaHCO3 buffer solution, with recoveries varying from 92.0% to 98.5%. The extracted solution was analyzed by SIL strategy, during which analytes and standards were labeled by 10-methyl-acridone-2-sulfonyl chloride (d0-MASC) and its deuterated counterpart d3-MASC, respectively. The labeling reaction was finished within 10 min with good stability. The liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS\/MS) sensitivity of BPs was greatly enhanced due to the mass-enhancing property of MASC, while the matrix effect was effectively minimized by the SIL strategy. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.10\u20130.30 \u03bcg\/kg, while the limits of quantitations (LOQs) were in the range of 0.32\u20131.0 \u03bcg\/kg.

The drying transition of water with decreasing spacing between pillars is related to the Wenzel (WZ) to Cassie\u2013Baxter (CB) transition of droplet. Our theory agrees with simulation for pillars with heights ranging from 11 to 100 nm.

Thymine-modified CNTs (CNT-Thy) can be dispersed in solution in the presence of diaminotriazine (DAT) end-functionalized polymers, through supramolecular Thy\/DAT association. DAT-polymer chains are selected according to the solvent chemical nature: polystyrene (PS) for hydrophobic\/low polarity solvents and a propylene oxide\/ethylene oxide copolymer (predominantly propylene oxide based, PPO\/PEO) for polar solvents or water. Long-term stable supramolecular CNT dispersions are reversibly aggregated by adding a few droplets of a selective dissociating agent of the Thy\/DAT association (DMSO). CNT-Thy, simply recycled by centrifugation or filtration, can be redispersed in another solvent in presence of a suitable soluble DAT-polymer.

However, the lack of targeting function of PTT agents hampers its clinical application. An effective and nontoxic delivery vehicle that can carry PTT agents into tumor areas is still needed urgently. In this study, we developed a multifunctional nanocomposite by loading copper sulfide (CuS) into Cy5.5-conjugated hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (HANP), obtaining an activatable Cy5.5\u2013HANP\/CuS (HANPC) nanocomposite. In this system, Cy5.5 fluorescent signal is quenched by CuS inside the particle until the whole nanocomposite is degraded by hyaluronidase present in tumor, giving strong fluorescence signals delineating the tumor. Importantly, CuS with strong NIR absorbance appears to be an excellent contrast agent for photoacoustic (PA) imaging and an effective PTT agent. After intravenous administration of HANPC into SCC7 tumor-bearing mice, high fluorescence and PA signals were observed in the tumor area over time, which peaked at the 6 h time point (tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 3.25 \u00b1 0.25 for optical imaging and 3.8 \u00b1 0.42 for PA imaging). The tumors were then irradiated with a laser, and a good tumor inhibition rate (89.74% on day 5) was observed. Our studies further encourage application of this HA-based multifunctional nanocomposite for image-guided PTT in biomedical applications, especially in cancer theranostics."},{"title":"Embedded Surface Relief Gratings by a Simple Method to Improve Absorption and Electrical Properties of Polymer Solar Cells","abstract":"We demonstrate a simple rubbing hole injection layer (HIL) to form surface relief gratings (SRGs) on the functional layers of polymer solar cells (PSCs). PSCs studied in this work consist of an ITO\/PEDOT:PSS(HIL)\/P3HT:PCBM(photoactive layer)\/LiF\/Al structure. SRGs are successfully formed on HIL in an effective rubbing process, and are over printed on the photoactive layer and cathode consequently. These triplet SRGs change the morphologies of interfaces of PSCs, which can increase optical path lengths, interaction between HIL and P3HT chains, and interface areas between electrode and photoactive layer. Both light trapping and electrical improvement are confirmed by theory and experiments, which lead to overall increase in short-circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. An average PCE of 3.8% is achieved from PSCs with SRGs without thermal annealing. Different from the directly rubbing the donor polymer film, a suitable degree of orientation of P3HT presents a lower dichroic ratio and higher photovoltaic response in our work."},{"title":"Perspectives on the Active Sites and Catalyst Design for the Hydrogenation of Dimethyl Oxalate","abstract":"What should people do with the huge amount of CO2 captured? CO2 to CO is a promising way for using carbon resources because CO is one component of syngas for the production of many important synthesis intermediates such as dimethyl oxalate (DMO). Hydrogenation of DMO provides an economical and eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of methyl glycolate, ethylene glycol (EG), and ethanol, which is often determined by the reaction conditions and catalysts with different active sites. Thus, DMO or EG is also an important carbon carrier or CO2 utilization product. Also, DMO hydrogenation is a representative reaction for studying the structure\u2013activity relationship in C\u2550O\/C\u2013O bond hydrogenation. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive review of the progress in DMO hydrogenation from the perspective of constructing and stabilizing the active sites. The silver and copper based catalysts with different structures and morphologies used for DMO hydrogenation have been discussed with regard to their catalytic performance and reaction mechanism. The synergy of Cu0 and Cu+ in DMO hydrogenation has been questioned, and new active sites are proposed with more experimental evidence. New reaction routes, hybrid active sites, and the effect of catalyst structure on the active sites for DMO hydrogenation have been achieved and reviewed. Moreover, a strategy of introducing organic additives to improve EG yield and stabilize copper species has been described. This work may help advance the understanding of active sites in DMO hydrogenation and guide the future rational design and fabrication of highly stable and low-cost DMO hydrogenation catalysts."},{"title":"Mutual Inhibition between Catalytic Impurities of Sulfur and Those of Calcium in Coke during Carbon\u2013Air and Carbon\u2013CO<sub>2<\/sub> Reactions","abstract":"The effect of sulfur and calcium impurities on coke reaction was investigated by simulating petroleum coke with low-impurity pitch coke and via impurity doping. Its mechanism has often been discussed via X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. The results show that sulfur has a strong catalytic effect on both the reactivity of coke in air and CO2 in the case with no other impurity interference. Its catalysis is probably realized by triggering a reaction system. However, during the carbon\u2013air and carbon\u2013CO2 reactions, an obvious mutual inhibition between the catalytic impurities of sulfur and those of calcium occurred when calcium was added. Inert CaSO4 and weak catalytic CaS are likely to be the key to producing this mutual inhibition."},{"title":"Internal Reorganization Energies for Copper Redox Couples:\u2009 The Slow Electron-Transfer Reactions of the [Cu<sup>II\/I<\/sup>(bib)<sub>2<\/sub>]<sup>2+\/+<\/sup> Couple","abstract":"[CuII(bib)2]2+ and [CuI(bib)2]+ (bib = 2,2\u2018-bis(2-imidazolyl)biphenyl) have similar geometries, with the Cu(II) complex best described as pseudo-square planar and the Cu(I) complex pseudo-tetrahedral.

Using the known E\u00b0 for the CoIII\/II couple yields E\u00b0 = 0.274 V vs Ag\/AgCl for [CuII\/I(bib)2]2+\/+. This, in turn, leads to K = 72 for reaction with [CoII((nox)3(BC4H9)2)]. The reaction of [CuII(bib)2]2+ with [CoII((nox)3(BC4H9)2)] obeys simple bimolecular kinetics with k = 87 M-1 s-1. Similar behavior occurs with [CoII((nox)3(BC6H5)2)] and [CoII((dmg)3(BC4H9)2)] as reductants. A value of k11 = 0.16 M-1 s-1 is calculated for the [CuII(bib)2]2+\/[CuI(bib)2]+ self-exchange reaction based on the Marcus cross-exchange relationship and the known electron-self-exchange rate constants for the Co(III)\/Co(II) couples. This value of k11 is remarkably small for a Cu(II\/I) system, especially in view of the small structural change at copper (\u0394(Cu\u2212N)ave = 0.07 \u00c5) during redox turnover. However, molecular mechanics calculations with newly developed copper force fields demonstrate \u0394G\u2021in to be the major factor that accounts for the small value of k11. Much of this large reorganization energy appears to arise from angular distortions around copper. Nevertheless, the structural changes for the [CuII\/I(bib)2]2+\/+ couple are small relative to those for systems that have much greater self-exchange rate constants. These considerations underscore the difficulties in applying the entatic hypothesis to cuproprotein active sites.

Similarly, nitric oxide (NO) is an important endogenous free radical with an antimicrobial effect and toxicity toward cancer cells that plays pivotal roles in several processes. In this work, biogenic AgNPs were prepared using green tea extract and the principles of green chemistry, and the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was prepared by the nitrosation of glutathione. To enhance the potentialities of GSNO and AgNPs in biomedical applications, the NO donor and metallic nanoparticles were individually or simultaneously incorporated into polymeric solid films of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The resulting solid nanocomposites were characterized by several techniques, and the diffusion profiles of GSNO and AgNPs were investigated. The results demonstrated the formation of homogeneous PVA\/PEG solid films containing GSNO and nanoscale AgNPs that are distributed in the polymeric matrix. PVA\/PEG films containing AgNPs demonstrated a potent antibacterial effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. GSNO-containing PVA\/PEG films demonstrated toxicity toward human cervical carcinoma and human prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the incorporation of AgNPs in PVA\/PEG\/GSNO films had a superior effect on the decrease of cell viability of both cancer cell lines, compared with cells treated with films containing GSNO or AgNPs individually. To our best knowledge, this is the first report to describe the preparation of PVA\/PEG solid films containing GSNO and\/or biogenically synthesized AgNPs.

In order to investigate the mechanism of product inhibition and whether it is a feature common to eukaryotic MnSODs, we purified MnSOD from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScMnSOD). It was a tetramer with 0.6 equiv of Mn per monomer. The catalytic activity of ScMnSOD was investigated by pulse radiolysis and compared with human and two bacterial (Escherichia coli and Deinococcus radiodurans) MnSODs.
