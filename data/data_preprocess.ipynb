       "  'abstract': 'We investigate electromagnetic propagation in uniaxial dielectrics with a transversely varying orientation of the optic axis, the latter staying orthogonal everywhere in the propagation direction. In such a geometry, the field experiences no refractive index gradients, yet it acquires a transversely modulated Pancharatnam–Berry phase, that is, a geometric phase originating from a spin–orbit interaction. We show that the periodic evolution of the geometric phase versus propagation gives rise to a longitudinally invariant effective potential. In certain configurations, this geometric phase can provide transverse confinement and waveguiding. The theoretical findings are tested and validated against numerical simulations of the complete Maxwell’s equations. Our results introduce and illustrate the role of geometric phases on electromagnetic propagation over distances well exceeding the diffraction length, paving the way to a whole new family of guided waves and waveguides that do not rely on refractive index tailoring.',\n",

Herein, we report that the shape of the energy surface, as demonstrated by an “interrupted”  mechanism, is altered in the presence of a copper cation, Cu. Natural bond-orbital and block-localized wave-function energy decomposition analyses suggest that orbital and electrostatic interactions play a major role in altering the shape of the energy surface. Applying additional external electric fields  induces a significant change to the energy surface with Cu present but negligible effects in the absence of Cu. These findings are consistent with recent studies that demonstrate that EEFs more readily stabilize/destabilize systems with larger, more polarizable, dipole moments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soil organic matter and clay minerals are responsible for the adsorption of many pesticides. Adsorption and competitive sorption of imidacloprid on clay minerals and humic acids  were determined using the batch equilibration method. The sorption coefficient of imidacloprid on humic acids was significantly higher than that on Ca-clay minerals, indicating that soil organic matter content was a more important property in influencing the adsorption of imidacloprid. Competitive sorption was investigated between imidacloprid and its main metabolite imidacloprid-urea on HA and Ca-clay minerals. The results showed that the sorption capacity of imidacloprid on clay minerals and HA was reduced in the presence of the metabolite, implying that imidacloprid-urea could occupy or block adsorption sites of imidacloprid on soil, potentially affecting the fate, transport, and bioavailability of imidacloprid in the environment. The interactions between a Ca-clay or HA-clay mixture and adsorption of imidacloprid and imidacloprid-urea were studied using IR differential spectra on thin films made of the adsorbent. The possible mechanisms were discussed from the shift of characteristic IR absorption bands of imidacloprid and imidacloprid-urea after sorption. ',\n",

Cyclic voltammetry in aqueous media  shows a single wave . With the gradual addition of LiCl/Li2SO4, this wave is shifted cathodically. Simultaneously, the value of ΔEp also gradually decreases from 58 to 37 mV in 1.0 M chloride and to 42 mV in 0.75 M sulfate media. Similar trends are also noticed in linear dc voltammograms. 4 in CH3CN  and Cl4 in CH2Cl2  media show two overlapping waves. In nitromethane, the redox process is complicated by adsorption. Because of the very small difference in redox potentials, the selective oxidation of one of the Ni centers to form a mixed-valent Ni−Ni species is not practical. However, during reductive decomposition of the bis-Ni species, a mixed-valent species could be identified. In stopped flow kinetics experiments, the UV−visible spectrum of a transient Ni−Ni intermediate in acetonitrile has been elucidated by one-electron reduction of the bis-Ni species with 2 . The differences in the redox behavior in various media are explained in terms of electrostatic interactions between the adjacent nickel centers influenced by sterically controlled axial ligation of counterions and solvents. Evidence for changes in coordination geometry in Ni and Ni species obtained from UV−vis and ESR studies is also presented. ',\n",

Isolation of dimeric 2 , using the less bulky 1- ligand, pointed to the need for gem-dimethyls adjacent to the sulfur to sterically prevent dimerization. All of the gem-dimethyl derivatized complexes are monomeric and, with the exception of , are isostructural and adopt a tetragonally distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry favored by ligand constraints. The nickel complex uniquely adopts an approximately ideal square pyramidal geometry and resembles the active site of Ni-superoxide dismutase .

The MII−S thiolate bonds systematically decrease in length across the series  with exceptions occurring upon the occupation of  orbitals. The copper complex, , represents a rare example of a stable CuII−thiolate, and models the perturbed “green” copper site of nitrite reductase. In contrast to the intensely colored, low−spin Fe−thiolates, the M−thiolates described herein are colorless to moderately colored and high−spin , reflecting the poorer energy match between the metal d- and sulfur orbitals upon reduction of the metal ion. As the d-orbitals drop in energy proceeding across the across the series M2 , the sulfur-to-metal charge-transfer transition moves into the visible region, and the redox potentials cathodically shift. The reduced M1 oxidation state is only accessible with copper, and the more oxidized M4 oxidation state is only accessible for manganese. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To observe in situ the adsorption of fatty acid onto metal surfaces, cross-sectional images of the adsorption layer were acquired by frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy . Hexadecane and palmitic acid were used as the base oil and typical fatty acid, respectively. A Cu-coated silicon wafer was prepared as the target substrate. The solvation structure formed by hexadecane molecules at the interface between the Cu substrate and the hexadecane was observed, and the layer pitch was found to be about 0.6 nm, which corresponds to the height of hexadecane molecules. This demonstrates that hexadecane molecules physically adsorbed onto the surface due to van der Waals forces with lying orientation because hexadecane is a nonpolar hydrocarbon. When hexadecane with palmitic acid was put on the Cu substrate instead of pure hexadecane, an adsorption layer of palmitic acid was observed at the interface. The layer pitch was about 2.5–2.8 nm, which matches the chain length of palmitic acid molecules well. This indicates that the original adsorption layer was monolayer or single bilayer in the local area. In addition, a cross-sectional image captured 1 h after observation started to reveal that the adsorbed additive layer gradually grew up to be thicker than about 20 nm due to an external stimulus, such as cantilever oscillation. This is the first report of in situ observation of an adsorbed layer by FM-AFM in the tribology field and demonstrates that FM-AFM is useful for clarifying the actual boundary lubrication mechanism.',\n",

We present the excitation spectrum of the 3p ← 2s and 3d ← 2s two-photon transitions for single Li atoms on HeN. The atoms are excited from the 2S ground state into Δ, Π, and Σ pseudodiatomic molecular substates. Excitation spectra are recorded by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization time-of-flight  mass spectroscopy, which allows an investigation of the exciplex  formation process in the Li–HeN system. Electronic states are shifted and broadened with respect to free atom states, which is explained within the pseudodiatomic model. The assignment is assisted by theoretical calculations, which are based on the Orsay–Trento density functional where the interaction between the helium droplet and the lithium atom is introduced by a pairwise additive approach. When a droplet is doped with more than one alkali atom, the fragility of the alkali–HeN systems leads preferably to the formation of high-spin molecules on the droplets. We use this property of helium nanodroplets for the preparation of Li dimers in their triplet ground state . The excitation spectrum of the 23Πg ← 13Σu transition is presented. The interaction between the molecule and the droplet manifests in a broadening of the transitions with a characteristic asymmetric form. The broadening extends to the blue side of each vibronic level, which is caused by the simultaneous excitation of the molecule and vibrations of the droplet . The two isotopes of Li form 6Li2 and 7Li2 as well as isotope mixed 6Li7Li molecules on the droplet surface. By using REMPI-TOF mass spectroscopy, isotope-dependent effects could be studied.',\n",

DLS study showed that the addition of NaSal leads to a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient of the whole micelle indicating micellar growth. QENS data analysis suggested that observed dynamics involves two distinct motions, lateral motion of the surfactant over the curved micellar surface and localized segmental motion of the surfactant. It is found that the addition of NaSal slows down the lateral motion of DTAB while the localized segmental motion of the DTAB chain is not affected much. An atomistic molecular dynamics  simulation was performed to gain further insight into the underlying phenomena. MD simulation results are found to be consistent with the experimental observations. MD simulation revealed that location of the salicylate ions on the micellar surface and their strong electrostatic association with their oppositely charged surfactant headgroup are the major factors in slowing down the lateral motion of the DTAB molecule.

       "  'abstract': 'We have studied the self-assembly of thiol monolayers on high-area nanostructured gold surfaces. These surfaces are highly irregular with a fractal dimension close to 2.5. Auger electron spectroscopy and voltammetric data indicate that thiol self-assembly with a maximum surface coverage ≈ 1/3 takes place, the same result as that found for smooth gold surfaces. Therefore, neither curvature effects, which would promote higher coverage, nor excluded volume effects, which would result in lower coverage, are present in these irregular surfaces. The high surface area of the bare electrodes exhibits a rapid surface decay in different liquid media that is hindered by alkanethiolate chemisorption. The presence of thiolate SAMs reduces markedly the mass transport surface diffusion of gold adatoms, hindering surface area decay and freezing the system in a metastable state for days. This effect cannot be explained by considering only hydrocarbon−hydrocarbon chain interactions, because it is also observed for ordered arrays of adsorbed S atoms. Therefore, interactions between ordered chemisorbed species at high coverage seem to be responsible for the observed behavior. The thiol-covered high-area metallic substrates can be used to efficiently anchor a large number of molecules, biomolecules, or nanostructures, improving the performance of SAM-based optical and electrochemical devices.

       "  'abstract': 'Studying the secondary structure of proteins leads to an understanding of the components that make up a whole protein. An understanding of the structure of the whole protein is often vital to understanding its digestive behavior in animals and nutritive quality. Usually protein secondary structures include -helix and -sheet. The percentages of these two structures in protein secondary structures may influence feed protein quality and digestive behavior. Feathers are widely available as a potential protein supplement. They are very high in protein , but the digestibility of the protein is very low . The objective of this study was to use synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared  microspectroscopy to reveal chemical features of feather protein secondary structure within amide I at ultraspatial resolution , in comparison with other protein sources from easily digested feeds such as barley, oat, and wheat tissue at endosperm regions . This experiment was performed at beamline U2B of the Albert Einstein Center for Synchrotron Biosciences at the National Synchrotron Light Source  in Brookhaven National Laboratory , U.S. Dept of Energy . The results showed that ultraspatially resolved chemical imaging of feed protein secondary structure in terms of -sheet to -helix peak height ratio by stepping in pixel-sized increments was obtained. Using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy can distinguish structures of protein amide I among the different feed protein sources. The results show that the secondary structure of feather protein differed from those of other feed protein sources in terms of the line-shape and position of amide I. The feather protein amide I peaked at ∼1630 cm-1. However, other feed protein sources showed a peak at ∼1650 cm-1. By using multicomponent peak modeling, the relatively quantitative amounts of -helix and -sheet in protein secondary structure were obtained, which showed that feather contains 88% -sheet and 4% -helix, barley contains 17% -sheet and 71% -helix, oat contains 2% -sheet and 92% -helix, and wheat contains 42% -sheet and 50% -helix. The difference in percentage of protein secondary structure may be part of the reason for different feed protein digestive behaviors. These results demonstrate the potential of highly spatially resolved infrared microspectroscopy to reveal feed protein secondary structure. Information from this study by the infrared probing of feed protein secondary structure may be valuable as a guide for feed breeders to improve and maintain protein quality for animal use. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors depends on their extravasation, but their efficacy is often compromised by intrinsic physiological heterogeneity in tumors. The conventional solutions to circumvent this problem are size control of nanoparticles or increasing the vascular permeability. The aim of this study is to investigate the combination effect of size variation of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles and improved vascular permeability triggered by near-infrared  light irradiation. Doxorubicin , a clinically proven drug for bladder cancer, was encapsulated in the nanocomposites with high loading content up to 45%. We show that NIR light-responsive size-switchable nanocarriers could considerably enhance the tumor-targeting of DOX in bladder tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, a combination of NIR-induced hyperthermia and DOX-mediated chemotherapy resulted in remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in mice. Histological results suggest that the change in morphology of tumor microvasculature may account for enhanced extravasation and accumulation of the nanodrugs upon NIR irradiation. Together, these data suggest that external stimuli-responsive drug delivery system offers a safe and effective means of targeted chemo/photothermal therapy.',\n",

To control the local concentrations of these ions in the vicinity of the TiO2 surface, a novel carbazole-based dye incorporating a 12-crown-4 ether on the carbazole donor  was synthesized as a DSSC sensitizer. The interactions between Li/I–/I3– and MK-70 were compared with those between Li/I–/I3– and MK-1, an analogue lacking the crown ether. The crown ether did not affect the ECB level of TiO2, but it did decrease  at a high electrolytic Li concentration. Results suggest that localized Li ions associated with the crown ethers electrostatically attract surplus I3– from the bulk electrolyte even though the crown ethers are located far from the TiO2 surface. After the cells were aged, negative shifts in the ECB levels of the TiO2 electrode and blueshifts of the MK-70 absorption spectra were observed with electrolytes that included I–/I3– and Li. The aging behavior may be determined by the balance between two attractive forces, K1  and K2 .',\n",

Ti film deposited on the NaCl  surface is induced to form epitaxial TiO film by thermal oxidation in air. Further thermal oxidation in air partially transformed TiO into anatase  with a parallel orientation relationship of {200}A//{200}TiO. Detailed analysis of the lattice fringes image of the specimen reveals the presence of very high density of misfit dislocations. The TiO to anatase transformation is reversible as further annealing in a vacuum can turn the anatase back into TiO and eliminates the misfit dislocations. The transformation is analyzed in terms of the crystal structure, orientation relationship, and the dislocation distribution, which show that the TiO to anatase transformation is due to the close similarity between their structures.',\n",

The success of this approach depends on optimizing the material conductivity, which until now has largely focused on minimizing the junction resistance between wires. However, there have been no detailed reports on what the junction resistance is, nor is there a known benchmark for the minimum attainable sheet resistance of an optimized network. In this paper, we present junction resistance measurements of individual silver nanowire junctions, producing for the first time a distribution of junction resistance values and conclusively demonstrating that the junction contribution to the overall resistance can be reduced beyond that of the wires through standard processing techniques. We find that this distribution shows the presence of a small percentage  of high-resistance junctions, and we show how these may impact the performance of network-based materials. Finally, through combining experiment with a rigorous model, we demonstrate the important role played by the network skeleton and the specific connectivity of the network in determining network performance.',\n",

The mixture used for the research testing was prepared with a high water content  in order to simulate the composition of the ecological fuel product from vegetable biomass fermentation. The experimental tests were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at a programmed temperature between 323 and 923 K. The maximum temperature  is the standard working temperature of a molten carbonate fuel cell able to make direct use of the hydrogen produced for ethanol steam reforming. The reaction mechanism starts with the initial dehydrogenation and/or dehydration of the ethanol, followed by rapid conversion of the products into methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The acid support  assists the dehydration of the alcohol, while all the other reactions are catalyzed by the Rh, although in different measures. For this reason, with increase in Rh content, there is also a progressive increase in the C1 , while the C2  disappear gradually from the outlet gaseous stream. The acetaldehyde, that is produced by dehydrogenation, is formed during an intermediate stage, but rapidly decomposes to CH4 and CO when working at high temperatures. Traces of acetaldehyde and hydrogen in a ratio of 1:1 are also present in the reaction products when pure Al2O3 is used. However in this case the main product of the reaction is the ethylene obtained by dehydration on the acid sites of the Al2O3. Obviously the presence of the ethylene assists the formation of carbon whiskers very strongly, which after only a few hours can be easily seen on the depleted catalyst. Vice versa, in the presence of Rh at high temperatures , coking does not occur and the catalyst maintains its activity for several hours transforming all the ethanol into C1 and H2. ',\n",

The immobilization is carried out using the native sulfide groups of immunoglobulin . To liberate the thiol groups, the intact IgG was split into two half-IgG fragments without destruction of the binding site of the antibody. The immobilization of half-IgG fragments on the gold surface was carried out by simple adsorption. The antigen binding capacity of the half-IgG modified gold supports is similar to that of the gold surfaces with the traditionally linked antibodies and is much higher than for nonspecifically adsorbed intact IgGs. The immobilized antibodies, according to the proposed approach, maintain high antigen binding constants. The immobilization procedure provides orientation of IgG fragments in terms of the similar distance between the binding site of the antibody and the surface of the gold support, which does not cause the distribution of the apparent affinity constants. The high operational stability of half-IgG modified gold electrodes makes them applicable for analytical applications. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Amyloid -peptide oligomer  is widely acknowledged as the promising biomarker for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease . In this work, we designed a three-dimensional  DNA walker nanoprobe for AO detection and real-time imaging in living cells and in vivo. The presence of AO triggered the DNAzyme walking strand to cleave the fluorophore -labeled substrate strand modified on the gold nanoparticle  surface and release TAMRA-labeled DNA fragment, resulting in the recovery of fluorescent signal. The entire process was autonomous and continuous, without external fuel strands or protease, and finally produced plenty of TAMRA fluorescence, achieving signal amplification effect. The nanoprobe enabled the quantitative detection of AO in vitro, and the limit of detection was 22.3 pM. Given the good biocompatibility of 3D DNA walker nanoprobe, we extended this enzyme-free signal amplification method to real-time imaging of AO. Under the microscope, nanoprobe accurately located and visualized the distribution of AO in living cells. Moreover, in vivo imaging results showed that our nanoprobe could be used to effectively distinguish the AD mice from the wild-type mice. This nanoprobe with the advantages of great sensitivity, high specificity, and convenience, provides an outstanding prospect for AD’s early diagnosis development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Stable isotopic content of dissolved organic carbon  provides valuable information on its origin and fate. In an attempt to get additional insights into DOC cycling, we developed a method for 13C measurement of DOC size classes by coupling high-performance liquid chromatography –size exclusion chromatography  to online isotope ratio mass spectrometry . This represents a significant methodological contribution to DOC research. The interface was evaluated using various organic compounds, thoroughly tested with soil–water from a C3–C4 vegetation change experiment, and also applied to riverine and marine DOC. 13C analysis of standard compounds resulted in excellent analytical precision . Chromatography resolved soil DOC into 3 fractions: high molecular weight , low molecular weight , and retained  fraction. Sample reproducibility for measurement of 13C-DOC size classes was ±0.25‰ for HMW fraction, ± 0.54‰ for LMW fraction, and ±1.3‰ for R fraction. The greater variance in 13C values of the latter fractions was due to their lower concentrations. The limit of quantification  for each size fraction measured as a peak is 200 ng C . 13C-DOC values obtained in SEC mode correlated significantly with those obtained without column in the EA mode , which rules out SEC-associated isotopic effects or DOC loss. In the vegetation change experiment, fractions revealed a clear trend in plant contribution to DOC; those in deeper soils and smaller size fractions had less plant material. It was also demonstrated that the technique can be successfully applied to marine and riverine DOC without further sample pretreatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The effect of pH, ionic strength, and cation in solution on the binding of phenanthrene by a soil humic acid in the aqueous phase was determined using fluorescence quenching. The phenanthrene binding coefficient with the dissolved soil humic, Koc, decreased with increasing ionic strength and solution cation valence. At low values of ionic strength, Koc values for this soil humic acid increased with increasing pH. For this humic sample, the experimental results were consistent with a conformational model of the humic substance in aqueous solution where, depending on solution conditions, some parts of the humic structure may be more open to allow increased PAH access to attachment sites. After sorption onto clays, supernatant solutions of the unadsorbed humic fraction yielded lower Koc values than the original bulk humic acid, suggesting that the humic substance was fractionating during its sorption onto the clays. Additionally, the extent of phenanthrene binding with the adsorbed humic fraction was lower than the results determined for the bulk humic acid prior to adsorption. The conformation of the humic substance when sorbed onto the inorganic surface appears to be affecting the level of phenanthrene binding by the humic acid. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hydrophobic organic chemicals  are of special ecotoxicological concern because they can be directly incorporated and bioconcentrated in living organisms. However, the effects of self-clustering of HOCs on their environmental behavior and toxicology have not yet received enough attention. With the use of a recently developed technique, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, the motion and distribution of perylene nanoclusters  formed in water at very low concentration  were visualized with high temporal and spatial resolution. The liquid–solid interface process of PNCs adsorbing onto graphene was also recorded. Instead of the traditional view of HOC adsorption as a single molecule, our study revealed the characteristic of irreversible adsorption of perylene onto the carbonaceous surface in the form of nanoclusters, exhibiting random sequential “car-parking” events. More interestingly, the transport of PNCs across the cell membrane was also captured in real time, demonstrating that they entered macrophage cells by endocytosis. Supplementing the well-recognized routine of passive diffusion through a membrane lipid bilayer, the uptake of HOCs in the form of nanoclusters by endocytosis is proposed to be an additional but important mechanism for their uptake into living cells. The distribution of HOCs in environmental systems in the form of nanoclusters, exemplified by PNCs in this study, may have significant implications for understanding their environmental fate and potential toxicological effects.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The initial stages of SBA-15 synthesis have been studied by using in situ time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering with a synchrotron radiation source. The quantitative analysis of X-ray scattering and diffraction intensities allows the structures of intermediates to be identified at the different stages of SBA-15 synthesis. Following tetraethylorthosilicate  addition, an intense small-angle scattering and an associated secondary maximum are observed, which are attributed to non-interacting surfactant template micelles encrusted with silicate species. After 25−30 min of the reaction, the broad scattering disappears and narrow Bragg diffraction peaks typical of hexagonally ordered structure are observed. The cylindrical micelles identified from X-ray scattering data appear to be the direct precursors of 2D hexagonal SBA-15 structure. Just after the formation of the SBA-15 hexagonal phase, the cylindrical micelles are only weakly linked in the hexagonal structure. As the synthesis proceeds, the solvent in the void volume between the cylindrical micelles is gradually replaced by more dense silicate species. The unit cell parameter of SBA-15 is progressively decreasing during the SBA-15 synthesis, which can be related to the condensation and densification of silicate fragments in the spaces between the cylinders. The volume fraction of the 2D hexagonally ordered phase is sharply growing during the first 2 h of the reaction. The inner core radius of SBA-15 material remains almost constant during the whole synthesis and is principally affected by the size of the poly inner core in the original cylindrical micelles. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Our previous work reported that Al2O3 inhibited the oxidative reactivity of MnO2 through heteroaggregation between oxide particles and surface complexation of the dissolved Al ions with MnO2 . The aim of the current work was to investigate interactions in ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al2O3, and NOM and how the interactions affect MnO2 oxidative reactivity. For the effect of Al ions, we examined ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al ions, and NOM. Our results indicated that an increase in the amount of humic acids  increasingly inhibited Al adsorption by forming soluble Al–HA complexes. As a consequence, there was less inhibition on MnO2 reactivity than by the sum of two binary mixtures . Alginate or pyromellitic acid —two model NOM compounds—did not affect Al adsorption, but Al ions increased alginate/PA adsorption by MnO2. The latter effect led to more inhibition on MnO2 reactivity than the sum of the two binary mixtures. In ternary mixtures of MnO2, Al2O3, and NOM, NOM inhibited dissolution of Al2O3. Zeta potential measurements, sedimentation experiments, TEM images, and modified DLVO calculations all indicated that HAs of up to 4 mg-C/L increased heteroaggregation between Al2O3 and MnO2, whereas higher amounts of HAs completely inhibited heteroaggregation. The effect of alginate is similar to that of HAs, although not as significant, while PA had negligible effects on heteroaggregation. Different from the effects of Al ions and NOMs on MnO2 reactivity, the MnO2 reactivity in ternary mixtures of Al2O3, MnO2, and NOM was mostly enhanced. This suggests MnO2 reactivity was mainly affected through heteroaggregation in the ternary mixtures because of the limited availability of Al ions.',\n",

This system is a gel-like crystalline phase where the microstructure evolves from reverse hexagonal to lamellar with increasing water content and/or temperature. Couette sheared 1H and 31P NMR experiments carried out at varying temperature and water content show distinct signatures with microstructure evolution. Because the system has been fully characterized through small-angle neutron scattering, it is possible to relate the NMR signatures to the microstructure. The NMR technique therefore complements scattering techniques but is additionally useful because the technique also picks up isotropic signatures from concurrently occurring noncrystalline phases. The use of NMR to identify such lyotropic gel-like crystalline phases allows easy correlation between templated materials synthesis in these phases and phase microstructure. NMR can therefore be used as a probe to understand microstructure in specific surfactant systems and to characterize the retention of microstructure during materials synthesis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Membrane equilibria are investigated using the Sogami potential for plate macroions. Two methods are used to calculate the ratio s of the electrolyte concentrations in the two phases in the two-phase region of colloid stability. This ratio depends sensitively on the value of the electric potential function at the midplane between the plates, Φd. The approximation Φd  0, corresponding to the neglect of double-layer overlap, is found to lead from Sogami theory to the Donnan membrane equilibrium. An exponentially decaying electric potential function is used to estimate the effect of including the double-layer overlap. It is found that the intermacroionic interactions suppress the Donnan effect, leading to a reduced value of s that is roughly constant as a function of the surface potential, for any physically realistic surface potential greater than 40 mV. It is noted that this calculation of s may provide an explanation for the relative salinity of cells and sea water. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aldose reductase, an NADPH dependent oxidoreductase, has received considerable attention due to its possible link to diabetic and galactosemic complications. It is known that the catalytic reaction involves a hydride shift from NADPH and a proton transfer from a suitable proton donor to the carbonyl group of the substrate. However, the details of the process are still unclear. The present work explores the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme by using the semi-microscopic protein dipoles Langevin dipoles  and the empirical valence bond  methods. The pKa values of His-110 and Tyr-48 are evaluated to determine which of these two residues donates the proton in the reaction. It is found that the free energy of protonation of His-110 in its protein site is ∼9 kcal/mol and hence the pKa of this residue is abnormally low. Consequently, His-110 is not protonated in the active site of aldose reductase. On the other hand, it is found that the pKa of Tyr-48 is lowered to ∼8.5 in the active site due to the stabilization by the unique local environment of the phenol group. We conclude that Tyr-48 acts as the proton donor in the reduction of aldehydes by aldose reductase, while the neutral His-110 has a role in substrate binding during the catalysis. To obtain a quantitative picture of the energetics of different feasible catalytic mechanisms in the protein we follow the EVB philosophy and calibrate the potential surface of the catalytic reaction in a solvent cage by using the relevant energetics from experiments. It is found that a mechanism where a proton transfer precedes the hydride transfer is unfavorable in the solvent cage, relative to the alternative mechanism where the hydride transfer precedes protonation. Furthermore, our study of the reaction in the actual protein environment indicates that an initial proton transfer step would require prohibitively high energy. Thus, the most probable catalytic mechanism commences with the hydride shift, followed by a proton transfer from Tyr-48. The calculations show that in water the activation barrier for the hydride shift is ∼20 kcal/mol, which is far above the barrier of the subsequent proton transfer. The protein environment stabilizes the transition state of the hydride shift by ∼3 kcal/mol and destabilizes the intermediate state by ∼8 kcal/mol relative to the corresponding states in the water cage. This finding is consistent with the physiological role of the enzyme in detoxification where it catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of carbonyl-containing substrates without particular specificity. It is argued that it may be difficult for an enzyme to both satisfy this demand and catalyze the reaction beyond the simple role of bringing the proton and hydride donor groups to the proximity of the substrate.

       "  'abstract': 'Organophosphorus compounds include many synthetic, neurotoxic substances that are commonly used as insecticides. The toxicity of these compounds is due to their ability to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholine esterase. Some of the most toxic organophosphates have been adapted for use as chemical warfare agents; the most well-known are GA, GB, GD, GF, VX, and VR. All of these compounds contain a chiral phosphorus center, with the SP enantiomers being significantly more toxic than the RP enantiomers. Phosphotriesterase  is an enzyme capable of detoxifying these agents, but the stereochemical preference of the wild-type enzyme is for the RP enantiomers. A series of enantiomerically pure chiral nerve agent analogues containing the relevant phosphoryl centers found in GB, GD, GF, VX, and VR has been developed. Wild-type and mutant forms of PTE have been tested for their ability to hydrolyze this series of compounds. Mutant forms of PTE with significantly enhanced, as well as relaxed or reversed, stereoselectivity have been identified. A number of variants exhibited dramatically improved kinetic constants for the catalytic hydrolysis of the more toxic SP enantiomers. Improvements of up to 3 orders of magnitude relative to the value of the wild-type enzyme were observed. Some of these mutants were tested against racemic mixtures of GB and GD. The kinetic constants obtained with the chiral nerve agent analogues accurately predict the improved activity and stereoselectivity against the authentic nerve agents used in this study.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The lithium-rich high-capacity cathode material LiO2 was investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy  to understand the role of Ni in the lithium-rich layered line in the pseudoternary system. The electronic structural changes that occur at different charged states were examined with soft XAS to understand the role of the secondary transition metal in controlling the stability. The Mn LII,III-edges reveal a relationship between Ni and the degree of structural transformation after the first cycle. Close examination of Li2MnO3 shows that Mn changes its oxidation state slightly during charging; however, there is a more dramatic change upon reduction from 4 to a value close to 3 at discharge, where it participates in the subsequent charge-compensation mechanism. The Ni LII,III-edges reveal that nickel acts as a stabilizer preventing the complete transformation of Mn by substitution reduction that is thought to couple with the anionic redox couple during the extended oxygen-activation plateau. The O K-edge reveals that loss of stability might be related to diminished d–sp hybridization occurring after oxygen activation, which is improved by the incorporation of nickel as a stabilizing agent. These findings clarify the complex relationships among nickel, manganese, and oxygen within lithium-rich high-capacity cathode materials in controlling stability while simultaneously obtaining high capacities exceeding 250 mA·h/g.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We studied the transport of room-temperature ionic liquids  through charged conical nanopores using a Landau–Ginzburg-type continuum model  that takes steric effect and strong ion–ion correlations into account. When the surface charge is uniform on the pore wall, weak current rectification is observed. When the charge density near the pore base is removed, the ionic current is greatly suppressed under negative bias voltage while nearly unchanged under positive bias voltage, thereby leading to enhanced current rectification. These predictions agree qualitatively with prior experimental observations, and we elucidated them by analyzing the different components of the ionic current and the structural changes of electrical double layers  at the pore tip under different bias voltages and surface charge patterns. These analyses reveal that the different modifications of the EDL structure near the pore tip by the positive and negative bias voltages cause the current rectification and the observed dependence on the distribution of surface charge on the pore wall. The fact that the current rectification phenomena are captured qualitatively by the simple model originally developed for describing EDLs at equilibrium conditions suggests that this model may be promising for understanding the ionic transport under nonequilibrium conditions when the EDL structure is strongly perturbed by external fields.',\n",

Calafate contains unusual phenolic compounds compared to other berries, such as anthocyanidin dihexosides, different from the common 3,5-diglucosides, and isomeric esters of caffeic acid with hexaric acids. After isolation, their structures have been elucidated by UV–vis, MS/MS, and NMR spectroscopies. The anthocyanidin dihexosides constitute the complete series of 3,7--O-diglucosides of the five anthocyanidins usually found in calafate, the structures of which were completely elucidated in the cases of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin derivatives and tentatively suggested in the cases of cyanidin and peonidin, and their occurrence seems to be characteristic of calafate among other wild berries from South Patagonia. With regard to caffeoyl-hexaric acids, two of four isomers have been assigned as 3- and 4-trans-caffeoyl-glucaric acids, but the determination of the linkage position for each isomer was not possible. A third isomer was also isolated, but it easily degraded and was suggested to be the 2- or 5-trans-caffeoyl-glucaric acid. The caffeoyl-glucaric acids account for around half of the pool of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in calafate.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Biological membranes are formed from the supramolecular aggregates of lipids, cholesterols, proteins, and other components such as carbohydrates. Harshness of personal cleaning products is related to surfactant interactions with proteins and lipids. Surfactants can damage biomembranes either by solubilizing their components in surfactant micelles or by fluidizing lipid bilayers through surfactant penetration. The interactions of surfactants with simpler biomembranes such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl choline liposomes were first studied , and then cholesterol and zein protein were added to make the liposomes more realistic. Sodium dodecyl sulfate  was used as a model surfactant for this purpose. Results show that while cholesterol makes the liposomes more resistant toward SDS, protein enhances the liposome solubilization processes. The mechanisms of the above process were investigated using a multipronged approach involving UV−visible spectroscopy, viscometry, and analytical ultracentrifugation. From viscometry and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis, it was seen that protein undergoes structural reorientation in the presence of SDS due to its strong affinity toward SDS, which stimulates the zein protein to be extracted away first from the bilayers. The preferential exits of zein protein out of the liposome membrane perturb the stability of the liposomes and enhance the liposome disintegration process. ',\n",

We present a description of a FricDiff unit. Such a unit consists of two compartments, the feed-side and the sweep-side, with a porous screen in between. The gas mixtures at the feed-side and the sweep gas interdiffuse through the screen. The basic modeling assumption is that the binary interaction of each feed-component with a counterflowing sweep gas is dominant. The interaction between the components diffusing in the same direction is neglected. This assumption leads us to introduce the number of “binary transfer units”. We show that more detailed models introduced earlier are approximated well by this approach. Also, experiments seem to exhibit the same scaling, although the constants needed to fit the experimental results deviate quite a lot from the theoretical predictions. The equations derived can be used straightforwardly for incorporating a FricDiff unit in a process design.',\n",

For this purpose, we implemented an integrative approach combining synthesis, spectral analysis, biochemical assays, and computational analysis. Specifically, we selected and synthesized novel ATP analogues bearing a chiral center on the phosphate chain. We analyzed the conformation of the chiral ATP analogues in solution by 1H/13C NMR and assigned the absolute configuration of the diastereoisomers. The coordination mode of these analogues with a Mg2 ion was evaluated by 31P NMR. These chiral analogues were biochemically evaluated and found to be potent h-P2Y1-R ligands. An EC50 difference of ca. 20-fold was observed between the diastereoisomers. Their spectral absolute configuration assignment was confirmed by comparison of the biochemical results to those of ATP--S diastereoisomers whose chirality is known. Finally, a computational analysis was performed for the elucidation of molecular recognition employing molecular mechanics  studies on the receptor:ligands complexes. On the basis of the current results, we hypothesize that h-P2Y1-R's chiral discrimination originates from the requirement that the nucleotide analogue interacts with a Mg2 ion within the receptor binding site. This Mg2 ion is possibly coordinated with both Asp204 and the ATP's , , -phosphates in a Λ configuration. \",\n",

Though highly selective organic cation exchange resins have been developed for most pollutants, they can serve as a growth medium for bacterial proliferation, impairing their long-term stability and introducing unpredictable parameters into the evolution of the system. Zeolites represent a family of inorganic cation exchangers, which naturally occur in hyper alkaline conditions and cannot serve as an electron donor or carbon source for microbial proliferation. Despite their successful application as industrial cation exchangers under near neutral conditions, their performance in hyper alkaline, saline water remains highly undocumented. Using Cs as a benchmark element, this study aims to assess the long-term cation exchange performance of zeolites in concrete derived aqueous solutions. Comparison of their exchange properties in alkaline media with data obtained in near neutral solutions demonstrated that the cation exchange selectivity remains unaffected by the increased hydroxyl concentration; the cation exchange capacity did however show an unexpected increase in hyper alkaline media.',\n",

In addition, a variety of model lipid membrane systems, such as freestanding horizontal membranes and droplet interface bilayers, are made using oil to facilitate membrane monolayer apposition. We characterize the behavior of excess oil inside horizontal freestanding lipid bilayers using different oils, focusing on hexadecane and squalene. Using a combination of second-harmonic  and white-light imaging, we measure how oil redistributes within the membrane bilayer after formation. SH imaging shows that squalene forms a wider annulus compared with hexadecane, suggesting that there is a higher quantity of squalene remaining in the bilayer compared with hexadecane. Excess oil droplets that appear right after membrane formation are tracked with white-light microscopy. Hexadecane droplets move directionally to the edge of the membrane with diffusion constants similar to those of single lipids, whereas squalene oil droplets move randomly with lower diffusion speeds similar to lipid condensed domains and remain trapped in the center of the bilayer for ∼1–3 h. We discuss the observed differences in terms of different coupling mechanisms between the oil and lipid molecules induced by the different chemical structures of the oils.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The core complex in photosynthetic bacteria plays a central role in photosynthesis. This molecular assembly is composed of two protein complexes, viz., the light-harvesting complex I , which absorbs sunlight by means of the protein-bound bacteriochlorophylls, and the reaction center , which uses the light-excitation energy absorbed by the LH complexes to produce a transmembrane  charge gradient, subsequently employed for energy conversion. In Rhodobacter  sphaeroides, the core complex contains, in addition, two copies of the single TM -helix protein, PufX, and forms a 2 dimer. To this date, no high-resolution structure has been reported for the entire core complex. In particular, the location of PufX within the 2 dimer is still the subject of much debate. Here, one of the proposed locations for PufX, requiring its dimerization, is examined. The PufX-dimer model on the basis of the glycophorin A  dimer was constructed, and its robustness was probed through a series of molecular dynamics  simulations. The free-energy change due to the replacement of Gly35 by valine was also determined to assess whether this mutation is responsible for distinct PufX oligomerization states in different Rba. species. The present study shows that PufX helices form a stable GpA-like dimer with a helix−helix crossing angle that could constitute the molecular basis of the reported highly bent and V-shaped structure of the Rba. sphaeroides core complex dimer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is becoming increasingly clear that the way in which a conjugated polymer film is cast affects the interactions between polymer chains and thus the optical and electrical properties of the film. Given that conjugated polymer films cast in different ways also show different nanometer-scale surface topographies, the question that arises is:\\u2009 What is the correlation between surface topography, local chain packing, and the local electronic properties of a conjugated polymer film? In this paper, we address this question using fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy  to examine films of poly-1,4-phenylene vinylene)  that were prepared in different ways. The spatially resolved photoluminescence  spectra collected on top of the nanometer-scale topographic features  exhibited by spin-cast MEH-PPV films show an enhancement of the red portion of the emission relative to spectra collected from flat regions of the film. Moreover, photooxidative damage  occurs much more quickly in the flat regions of the MEH-PPV films than on the topographic bumps. Taken together, these observations suggest that the bumps on the films correspond to regions in which the chains are packed more tightly:\\u2009 the red-shifted emission results from increased interchain interactions, while the decreased photooxidation rate results from the fact that oxygen cannot easily diffuse between the tightly packed polymer chains. We also find that the spatial homogeneity of MEH-PPV films can be greatly improved by annealing:\\u2009 heating the films above the glass transition temperature removes the topographic features and produces a uniform but weak and red-shifted SRPL due to increased interchain interactions. In contrast to spin-cast films, the SRPL of annealed films undergoes a blue-shift upon photooxidation. This result can be explained by considering the differences between the local chain packing in annealed and nonannealed films, combined with the fact that excitations in the film tend to migrate to low-energy aggregated-chain “traps”. All of these results provide insight into how polymer film morphology can be controlled through film processing conditions to improve the optical properties and the performance of electroluminescent devices based on this class of materials.

       "  'abstract': 'A novel ligand based on a pyridine-containing macrocycle bearing two acetic and one methylenephosphonic arms  has been synthesized. An efficient synthesis of PCP2A is based on the macrocyclization reaction between 2,6-bispyridine and a 1,4,7-triazaheptane derivative bearing a methylenephosphonate group on N-4. The Gd complex of PCP2A displays characteristic properties which make it a very promising contrast agent for improved applications in magnetic resonance imaging. In fact it shows  a very high stability constant  which should guarantee against the in vivo release of toxic free Gd ions and free ligand molecules and  a relaxivity that is about 2 times higher than the values reported for contrast agents currently used in the clinical practice. Its high relaxivity is the result of the presence of two water molecules in the inner coordination sphere and a significant contribution from water molecule hydrogen bonded to the phosphonate group. Moreover, the inner sphere water molecules are involved in an exchange with the bulk water which is relatively fast. This property is important for the attainment of an even higher relaxivity once the molecular reorientation rate of the - moiety is lengthened by means of conjugation to a macromolecular substrate.

Because of their large application to agriculture fields and the toxicity of MMA and DMA, the persistency of these compounds in the environment is of great concern. MMA and DMA sorption and desorption were investigated in soils, varying in mineralogical and organic matter  contents. Sorption studies showed that the MMA sorption capacity and rate were greater than DMA sorption. Al/Fe-oxyhydroxides were the main sorbents in the soils, and the sorption capacity was proportional to the Al/Fe concentration in the soils. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure  studies showed that both MMA/DMA-Fe interatomic distances were around 3.3 Å, which were indicative of bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complex formation. Desorption studies showed that not all of the sorbed MMA or DMA was desorbed due to the strong binding between MMA/DMA and Al/Fe-oxyhydroxide surfaces via possible inner-sphere complex formation. The amount of the desorbed MMA and DMA decreased as the sorption residence time increased. For example, 77% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the Reybold subsoil after 1 day residence time, while 66% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the soil after six months of residence time.

       "  'abstract': 'Multifunctional star-graft quarterpolymers PSnn with two different arm types, shorter PS arms and longer P2VP-b-PAA block copolymer arms with grafted PNIPAM chains, were studied in terms of their ability to form micellar structures at the air/water and air/solid interfaces. Because of the pH-dependent ionization of P2VP and PAA blocks, as well as thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAM chains, these multifunctional stars have multiple responsive properties to pH, temperature, and ionic strength. We observed that the molecular surface area of the stars is the largest at basic pH, when the PAA blocks are strongly charged and extended, and PNIPAM chains are spread at the interface. At acidic conditions, the molecular surface area is the smallest because the P2VP blocks submerge into the water subphase and the PAA blocks are contracted and form hydrogen bonding with grafted PNIPAM chains. The molecular surface area of the stars at the air/water interface gradually increases at elevated temperature. We suggest that the transition across lower critical solution temperature  results in the emerging of PNIPAM chains from the water subphase to the interface due to the hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition. Moreover, at higher surface pressure, the stars tend to form intermolecular micellar aggregates above LCST. The graft density of PNIPAM chains as well as the arm number was also found to have strong effects on the thermo- and pH-response. Overall, this study demonstrates that the star block copolymer conformation and aggregation are strongly dependent on the intramolecular interactions between different blocks and spatial distribution of the arms, which can be controlled by the external conditions, including pH, temperature, ionic strength, and surface pressure.',\n",

Here, we investigated the magnitude and variability of C and N isotope fractionation during the indirect phototransformation of four para-substituted anilines in aerated aqueous solutions. The model photosensitizers, namely 9,10-anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate and methylene blue, were used as surrogates for dissolved organic matter chromophores generating excited triplet states in sunlit surface waters. The transformation of aniline, 4-CH3-, 4-OCH3-, and 4-Cl-aniline by excited triplet states of the photosensitizers was associated with inverse and normal N isotope fractionation, whereas C isotope fractionation was negligible. The apparent 15N kinetic isotope effects  were almost identical for both photosensitizers, increased from 0.9958 ± 0.0013 for 4-OCH3-aniline to 1.0035 ± 0.0006 for 4-Cl-aniline, and correlated well with the electron donating properties of the substituent. N isotope fractionation is pH-dependent in that H exchange reactions dominate below and N atom oxidation processes above the pKa value of the substituted aniline’s conjugate acid. Correlations of C and N isotope fractionation for indirect phototransformation were different from those determined previously for the direct photolysis of chloroanilines and offer new opportunities to distinguish between abiotic degradation pathways.',\n",

Twenty-two percent of the resuspended PCBs desorbed after 2 h, and 35% ± 8% of PCBs were in the dissolved phase after apparent steady state was reached in 2 days. After the first resuspension event, the solids were allowed to settle and the quiescent time was varied to determine whether the labile pool of PCBs is recharged during sediment consolidation. The steady-state log Koc values for the third subsequent resuspension were higher than for the first event due to lower dissolved PCB concentrations; the particulate PCB concentrations were constant between events. With 1 day of consolidation between resuspension events, the dissolved concentration of all congeners decreased an average of 8% ± 5% between subsequent resuspension events. With 4 days between events, only the dissolved pentachlorinated PCBs decreased significantly , suggesting that the easily desorbable PCBs recharge when there is sufficient time between resuspension events.

We investigated the effect of solvent-induced swelling on the kinetics of multiple energy transfer in nanoparticles of the conjugated polymers PFBT and MEH-PPV. Multiple energy transfer between equivalent chromophores results in an increased rate of quenching by defects due to a cascading or funneling effect. The effects of swelling on energy transfer between polymer chromophores and the resulting exciton dynamics were modeled using a random walk on a lattice of chromophores. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental fluorescence quantum yield, and decay kinetics results at low to moderate THF concentrations. We found that the time scale for energy transfer between chromophores  is highly sensitive to swelling, slowing by an order of magnitude or more for swelled particles. The results support quenching by defects or polarons, amplified by multiple energy transfer or a cascade effect, as a likely explanation for the typically low fluorescence quantum yield of conjugated polymer particles as compared to the free polymer in solution as well as similar effects observed in thin films.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the course of formulating detailed models of complex chemical reactions, it is sometimes the case that modifications intended to account for one set of experimental observations wind up destroying a model's ability to account for other results. Here, we consider a recently proposed model of the peroxidase-oxidase reaction which derives from an earlier scheme via the addition of NADH oxidation by superoxide anion or its protonated form, hydroperoxyl radical. This modification was introduced to account for the observation of bistability and bursting at enzyme concentrations less than 0.5 M. Left unanswered in our previous paper was the matter of whether the proposed “fix” invalidates previously published examples of model-data agreement at higher enzyme concentrations. In the present paper, we show that under these latter circumstances, the new mechanism is as good as, and in some instances superior to, its predecessor. More generally, we argue that the consequences of NADH oxidation by O2- or HO2• should be manifest principally at low enzyme concentrations, thereby offering a “global” explanation of our findings. Neither our original model, nor the derivative scheme treated here, provides for reactions involving NAD dimers, a species in which there has recently been renewed interest. Most importantly, it has been proposed to replace the reduction of coIII  by NAD radicals, a reaction for which there is no direct evidence, with the corresponding reaction involving NAD2. While a detailed assessment of the consequences of dimer chemistry to theoretical peroxidase-oxidase dynamics is beyond the scope of the present investigation, it is easily documented that this substitution, by itself, abolishes oscillatory behavior for all model parametrizations previously considered. Moreover, this result appears to obtain for arbitrarily small values of the associated rate constant. Whether or not the inclusion of additional dimer reactions can restore the model's ability to account for experimental observations of complex dynamics remains to be determined. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hexavalent Np, Pu, and Am individually, and as a group, have all been cocrystallized with UO22·6H2O, constituting the first demonstration of an An group cocrystallization. The hexavalent dioxo cations of Np, Pu, and Am cocrystallize with UO22·6H2O in near proportion with a simple reduction in temperature, while the lower valence states, An and An, are only slightly removed from solution. A separation of An species from An ions by crystallization has been demonstrated, with an observed separation factor of 14. Separation of An species from key fission products, 95Zr, 95Nb, 137Cs, and 144Ce, has also been demonstrated by crystallization, with separation factors ranging from 6.5 to 71 in the absence of Am, while in the presence of Am, the separation factors were reduced to 0.99–7.7. One interesting observation is that Am shows increased stability in the cocrystallized form, with no reduction observed after 13 days, as opposed to in solution, in which &gt;50% is reduced after only 10 days. The ability to cocrystallize and stabilize hexavalent actinides from solution, especially Am, introduces a new separations approach that can be applied to closing the nuclear fuel cycle.',\n",

At 238 K, under slow exchange conditions, the upfield shift experienced by the xenon atom upon complexation by 1  is increased  when the hosts are deuterated. By using mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated hosts, such as 1 and 6, the dynamics of a xenon atom can thus be traced between three different sites . We have demonstrated that some of the dynamic features of the exchange between these sites can be extracted from 2D-EXSY experiments, using a suitable kinetic model. We conclude that the exchange of a xenon atom between different hosts occurs by travelling through the solution rather than upon collision of two hosts. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"A new polymorph of NaSbO3 has been synthesized at 10.5 GPa and 1150 °C in a uniaxial split sphere anvil type press  and recovered back to ambient conditions. The high-pressure form of NaSbO3 adopts an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure, isostructural with CaTiO3, GdFeO3, and NaTaO3. The space group is Pnma, and the unit cell dimensions are a  5.43835 Å, b  7.66195 Å, c  5.38201 Å. It is a white insulator with an optical band gap of 3.4 eV. This compound represents the first ternary perovskite prepared containing Sb5 on the octahedral site. The octahedral tilting distortion in this compound is much larger than expected from ionic radii considerations. The distortion is driven by a second-order Jahn−Teller distortion originating on oxygen that can be traced back to strong Sb−O covalent bonding. A conflict arises between the strong covalent bonding interactions at oxygen that favor a large octahedral tilting distortion and the repulsive Na−O interactions that oppose excessive octahedral tilting. This conflict destabilizes the perovskite topology, thereby stabilizing the ilmenite polymorph under ambient conditions. Analysis of ionic and covalent bonding explains why ASbO3 and ABiO3 compositions frequently adopt structures that violate Pauling's rules. \",\n",

As a result of their considerable size and their pronounced effects on DNA–protein interactions, DPCs can interfere with DNA replication, transcription, and repair, potentially leading to mutagenesis, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. However, the biological consequences of these ubiquitous lesions are not fully understood due to the difficulty of generating DNA substrates containing structurally defined, site-specific DPCs. In the present study, site-specific cross-links between the two biomolecules were generated by copper-catalyzed  Huisgen cycloaddition  between an alkyne group from 5--uracil in DNA and an azide group within engineered proteins/polypeptides. The resulting DPC substrates were subjected to in vitro primer extension in the presence of human lesion bypass DNA polymerases , , , and . We found that DPC lesions to the green fluorescent protein and a 23-mer peptide completely blocked DNA replication, while the cross-link to a 10-mer peptide was bypassed. These results indicate that the polymerases cannot read through the larger DPC lesions and further suggest that proteolytic degradation may be required to remove the replication block imposed by bulky DPC adducts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Annual cycles of the atmospheric concentrations of PCBs were determined at 16  stations around the Baltic Sea between 1990 and 1993. The concentration levels of individual congeners were found to be influenced by their physical-chemical properties, ambient temperature, and geographical location. Median levels of PCBs were similar at all stations except at one urban site near Riga. A latitudinal gradient with higher levels in the south was found for the sum of PCB as well as for individual congeners, and the gradient was more pronounced for the low volatility congeners. As a result, the high volatility congeners increased in relative importance with latitude. Generally, PCB concentrations increased with temperature, but slopes of the partial pressure in air versus reciprocal temperature were different between congeners and between stations. In general, the low volatility congeners were more temperature dependent than the high volatility PCB congeners. Steep slopes at a sampling location indicate that the concentration in air is largely determined by diffusive exchange with soils. Lack of a temperature dependence may be due to the influence of long-range transported air masses at remote sites and due to the episodic or random nature of PCB sources at urban sites. ',\n",

The experimental and computational study here of a -ketoacid decarboxylation shows how the distinction between the two mechanisms breaks down near its border due to the differing time scales for proton versus heavy-atom motion. Isotope effects in the decarboxylation of benzoylacetic acid support a transition state in which the proton transfer is complete. In quasiclassical trajectories passing through this transition state, the new O–H bond after proton transfer undergoes several vibrations before heavy-atom motion completes the reaction. The bonding changes are thus temporally separated at a “dynamic intermediate” structure that acts equivalently to an ordinary intermediate in the trajectories, including the reversal of trajectories at the intermediate when the second “step” fails, but the structure is not an energy minimum. The results define a border between mechanisms where the usual energetic definition of intermediates is not meaningful.',\n",

The latter value is larger due to a combination of greater stability of the sulfide relative to the oxide and of the relative instability of thiepin compared to oxepin. For the dimethyl analog of the benzene oxide/oxepin system  the ΔH at the same level is −6.73 kJ mol-1. The calculated molecular orbital energies are in linear relationship to those available from photoelectron spectra and suggest reassignment in some cases. The structures of the transition states for the conformational inversion of oxepin and of thiepin are shown to be planar, and the QCISD enthalpies of inversion are 14.5 and 30.5 kJ mol-1, respectively.

The HPLC method allows us to simultaneously determine and quantify several sulfur-containing reagents such as 2CSO2, 2CSO3, 2CO, and SO32- . Experiments illustrate that the decomposition of thiourea oxides is a first-order reaction, in which the rate constants increase with the pH of the solution. Oxidations of thiourea oxides by hydrogen peroxide are first order with respect to both reagents within the studied pH range between 4.0 and 8.0. Oxidation rate constants are measured under different pH conditions, which show that increasing the pH of the reaction solution significantly accelerates the oxidation process. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Heterogeneous charge transfer processes at sensitized wide bandgap semiconductor surfaces are imperative for both fundamental knowledge and technical applications. Herein, we focus on the investigation of carrier dynamics of a triphenylamine-based dye, LEG4, sensitized TiO2  in contact with two types of electrolyte systems: pure cobalt-based electrolytes and in combination with an organic donor, triamine . Four different cobalt redox systems with potentials spanning a 0.3 V range were studied, and the carrier recombination and regeneration kinetics were monitored both at low and at high TiO2  densities . The results reveal that the introduction of the TPAA intermediate more effectively suppress the recombination loss of TiO2  under high charge conditions, close to open-circuit, as compared to low charge conditions. As a result, the charge transfer from the cobalt complexes to the oxidized dyes is significantly improved by the addition of TPAA. Dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the TPAA-containing electrolytes demonstrate remarkable improvement in both VOC and JSC and lead to more than 25% increase of the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Furthermore, an unprecedented detrimental impact of TPAA on the device performance was identified when the redox potential of the TPAA donor and the cobalt complexes are close. This is ascribed to the formation of TPAA• which can act as an active recombination centers and thus lower the solar cell performance. These insights point at a strategy to enhance the lifetimes of electrons generated in sensitized semiconductor electrodes by overcoming the charge recombination between TiO2 and the oxidized dye under high carrier densities in the semiconductor substrate and offer practical guidance to the design of future efficient electrolyte systems for dye-sensitized solar cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The molecular motion in water of the poly-poly-poly triblock copolymer with the nominal composition EO97PO68EO97  was investigated with the aid of pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance . The signal decays in the PFG experiments have been recorded for 1 wt % F127 in the temperature range from 288 to 313 K and in the concentration range 0.1−35 wt % at 298 K. Below the critical micellization temperature  or the critical micellization concentration , the PFG signal decays approximately linearly when the intensities are plotted on a logarithmic scale versus the experimentally relevant parameter. At the cmt or cmc, the signal decays are curved. The NMR data were processed using inverse Laplace transformation to obtain the distribution of self-diffusion coefficients, P. At 288 K for a 1 wt % solution, a narrow distribution was observed, while at 302 K a bimodal distribution was observed. This observation can be explained by the polydispersity of the polymer. It implies that, at a given temperature, only the more hydrophobic compound of F127 takes part in the aggregation process, while the more hydrophilic components diffuse as free nonassociated polymer. Increasing the temperature to 313 K resulted in a monomodal distribution, suggesting that all the polymers are aggregated. It is suggested that an ideal mixing model for the Pluronic micelles can explain the self-diffusion data. The NMR self-diffusion raw data were also analyzed with the COmponent REsolved  algorithm, resulting in spectra for free block copolymer and micellized block copolymer. With an increase in temperature, the intensity of the peaks for free block copolymer is reduced, whereas the intensity of the peaks for aggregated block copolymer increases. The ratios between the size of the PEO and PPO blocks  show a marked increase in free polymer compared to the ratio observed in micellized polymer when the temperature is increased. The effect of added salts to a 1 wt % F127 solution at 303 K was investigated to determine how the populations of free and micellized surfactant were changed on account of the ions present. Finally, the diffusion behavior of Pluronic F68  at 35 wt % has been investigated from 298 to 313 K. Both the diffusion time and the time of the gradient have been varied. The data show that the diffusion is Gaussian in the temperature range. ',\n",

The former is the homogeneous wetting regime, usually described by the Wenzel equation. The latter is the heterogeneous wetting regime that is described by the Cassie−Baxter equation. Understanding this “competition” is essential for the design of ultrahydrophobic surfaces. The present discussion puts the Wenzel and Cassie−Baxter equations into proper mathematical−thermodynamic perspective and defines the conditions for determining the transition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous wetting regimes. In particular, a new condition that is necessary for the existence of the heterogeneous wetting regime is added. It is demonstrated that when this condition is violated, the homogeneous wetting regime is in effect, even though the Cassie−Baxter equation may be satisfied. ',\n",

From the vibrational frequencies and especially by the presence of a band at 3650 cm−1, it is found that the gold species after calcination are probably present under the form of digrafted chemisorbed species.

The activity of the support was compared with that of fully formulated catalysts containing palladium. The Pd/CeZrAlOx material exhibited long-term stability and selectivity to propene , which is not normally associated with dehydrogenation catalysts. From temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 it was found that the catalyst possessed both acidic and basic sites. In addition, temperature-programmed reduction showed that palladium promoted both the reduction and reoxidation of the support. When the role of CO2 was investigated in the absence of gas-phase oxidant, using a temporal analysis of products  reactor, it was found that CO2 dissociates over the reduced catalyst, leading to formation of CO and selective oxygen species. It is proposed that CO2 has the dual role of regenerating selective oxygen species and shifting the equilibrium for alkane dehydrogenation by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction.

       "  'abstract': 'The oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is catalyzed by a number of flavin-dependent enzymes, which have been grouped in the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase enzyme superfamily. These enzymes exhibit little sequence similarity in their substrates binding domains, but share a highly conserved catalytic site, suggesting a similar activation mechanism for the oxidation of their substrates. In this study, the fully conserved histidine residue at position 466 of choline oxidase was replaced with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis and the biochemical, spectroscopic, and mechanistic properties of the resulting CHO-H466A mutant enzyme were characterized. CHO-H466A showed kcat and kcat/Km values with choline as substrate that were 60- and 1000-fold lower than the values for the wild-type enzyme, while the kcat/Km value for oxygen was unaffected, suggesting the involvement of His466 in the oxidation of the alcohol substrate but not in the reduction of oxygen. Replacement of His466 with alanine significantly affected the microenvironment of the flavin, as indicated by the altered behavior of CHO-H466A with sulfite and dithionite. In agreement with this conclusion, a midpoint reduction potential of 106 mV for the two-electron transfer in the catalytically competent enzyme−product complex was determined at pH 7 for CHO-H466A, which was ∼25 mV more negative than that of the wild-type enzyme. Enzymatic activity in CHO-H466A could be partially rescued with exogenous imidazolium, but not imidazole, consistent with the protonated form of histidine exerting a catalytic role. pH profiles for glycine betaine inhibition, the deprotonation of the N-flavin locus, and the kcat/Km value for choline all showed a significant shift upward in their pKa values, consistent with a change in the polarity of the active site. Finally, kinetic isotope effects with isotopically labeled substrate and solvent indicated that the histidine to alanine substitution affected the timing of substrate OH and CH bond cleavages, consistent with removal of the hydroxyl proton being concerted with hydride transfer in the mutant enzyme. All taken together, the results presented in this study suggest that in choline oxidase, His466 modulates the electrophilicity of the enzyme-bound flavin and the polarity of the active site, and contributes to the stabilization of the transition state for the oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde.

Oxygen-saturated polysilane solutions in benzene exhibit a strong transient absorption band ascribed to the polysilane radical cation. The transient species react with N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylene-diamine  to produce TMPD radical cations. On the basis of the molar extinction coefficient of the TMPD radical cation, the molar extinction coefficients for the radical cations of polysilanes are found to increase in the range 3.3 × 104 to 2.0 × 105 M-1 cm-1 with increasing polymer segment length. The stepwise increase in the total oscillator strength with an increase in the number of phenyl rings directly bonded to the Si skeleton suggests the delocalization of the positive polaron state and/or the SOMO state over the phenyl rings, indicating the importance of phenyl rings in intermolecular hole transfer processes.

       "  'abstract': 'Xenobiotics such as explosives and pesticides released into the environment can have lethal and sublethal impacts on soil organisms such as earthworms with potential subsequent impacts at higher trophic levels. To better understand the molecular toxicological mechanisms of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene , a commonly used explosive, in Eisenia fetida, earthworms were exposed to a gradient of TNT-spiked soils for 28 days and impacts on gene expression were examined using a 4032 cDNA microarray. Reproduction was increased at low doses of TNT, whereas high doses of TNT reduced juvenile production. On the basis of reproduction responses to TNT, four treatments, that is, control, 2, 10.6, and 38.7 mg/kg, were selected for gene expression studies in a balanced interwoven loop design microarray experiment in which the expression of 311 transcripts was significantly affected. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  data on 68 selected differentially and nondifferentially expressed transcripts showed a significant correlation with microarray results. The expression of genes involved in multiple biological processes was altered, including muscle contraction, neuronal signaling and growth, ubiquitinylation, fibrinolysis and coagulation, iron and calcium homeostasis, oxygen transport, and immunity. Chitinase activity assays confirmed down-regulation of chitinase genes as indicated by array and RT-QPCR data. An acute toxicity test provided evidence that dermal contact with TNT can cause bleeding, inflammation, and constriction, which may be explained by gene expression results. Sublethal doses of TNT affected the nervous system, caused blood disorders similar to methemoglobinemia, and weakened immunity in E. fetida.',\n",

It also reveals that, in certain interaction configurations, adsorption induces substantial reorganization of the hydrogen-bonding network at the ice surface. Comparison with experiments validates the novel theoretical methodology relying on the density functional-based tight binding approach, which offers a compromise between the system size and accuracy, enabling a wide sampling of surface structures. Applied in an astrophysical context, this study suggests that widening of the dOH feature by adsorption of aromatic molecules could explain its absence heretofore in observational ice spectra, offering hope that future missions with higher sensitivity will verify its presence or absence in dense regions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The unpaired spin populations and spin-pairing tendencies of the three different vanadium atoms of NaV6O11 above and below its trimerization temperature Tt  245 K were examined by determining, as a function of the number of unpaired spins per formula unit, N, the total energies of NaV6O11 as well as the 3d orbital populations of the V, V, and V atoms on the basis of first-principles spin-polarized electronic band structure calculations. Spin dimer analysis was also carried out to estimate the spin-pairing tendencies of the V and V sites above and below Tt. Our work does not support the heuristic assumptions employed to interpret the magnetic properties of NaV6O11 as well as its analogues SrV6O11 and PbV6O11. States with a wide range of N values  are expected to contribute to the magnetic properties of NaV6O11 above and below Tt. The V, V, and V atoms differ mainly in the extents of their spin polarizations but not in their oxidation states. The unpaired spin population of each V site is significantly reduced by the trimerization but remains nonzero below Tt. The V sites, which are present as dimer units, are not diamagnetic. The V and V sites each have approximately one unpaired spin per site above and below Tt. ',\n",

Many such proteoforms are isomers  that require separation followed by top-down or middle-down mass spectrometric analyses, but condensed-phase separations are ineffective in those size ranges. The variants for “middle-down” peptides were resolved by differential ion mobility spectrometry , relying on the mobility increment at high electric fields, but not previously by linear IMS on the basis of absolute mobility. We now use complete histone tails with diverse PTMs on alternative sites to demonstrate that high-resolution linear IMS, here trapped IMS , broadly resolves the variants of ∼50 residues in full or into binary mixtures quantifiable by tandem MS, largely thanks to orthogonal separations across charge states. Separations using traveling-wave  and/or involving various time scales and electrospray ionization source conditions are similar , showing the transferability of results across linear IMS instruments.

Our objective is to understand the organization of complex interfaces between blood plasma preparations of various compositions and model titania surfaces. Here we present the results of the morphological and chemical characterization of TiO2 surfaces incubated with four types of blood plasma preparations devoid of leukocytes and red blood cells: either enriched in platelets  or platelet-depleted, and either activated with CaCl2 to induce clotting, or not. Chemical characterization was done by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with principal component analysis . The interface morphology was studied with scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify platelets and infer their activation state. We observe clear differences among the four types of interfaces by ToF-SIMS/PCA. Some of these could be straightforwardly related to the differences in the sample morphology and known effects of platelet activation, but others are more subtle. Strikingly, it was possible to differentiate between these samples by ToF-SIMS/PCA of the protein species alone. This clearly indicates that the composition, orientation, and/or conformation of the proteins in these specimens depend both on the platelets' presence and on their activation. The ToF-SIMS imaging functionality furthermore provides unique insight into the distribution of phospholipid species in these samples.\",\n",

These include in situ synthesis directly on the array surface, for example, by photolithography or ink-jet printing technologies, and the application of presynthesized polynucleotides that are derivatized with various nucleophiles or electrophiles. In the latter case, a variety of surface chemistries have been developed, and several are available commercially. These chemistries must be compatible with nanoliter-scale volumes of polynucleotide reagents, which contact the array over a small portion of their surface. We reasoned that a three-dimensional polymer coating could potentially offer greater surface contact and higher binding efficiency. Here we describe a polyethylenimine-based coating chemistry that provides exceptional binding and hybridization characteristics. In our preferred process, size-fractionated polyethylenimine polymers are cross-linked onto an aminopropylsilanated glass surface in the presence of cyanuric chloride. The resulting three-dimensional coating binds polynucleotides through a mixture of covalent and noncovalent interactions as evidenced by comparisons between 5-aminoalkyl modified and unmodified polynucleotides. Binding and hybridization comparisons are presented including analogous two-dimensional electrophilic and electrostatic chemistries. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rotor–stator wet mills are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to reduce particle size and normalize API physical properties as a means to facilitate downstream drug product operations and/or achieve targeted in vivo product performance. Wet milling is robust, relatively easy to use, broadly applicable, and offers both financial and API physical property advantages over dry milling. Historical rotor–stator wet mill technologies are generally capable of achieving particles sizes down to ∼25 m. Newer high-shear wet mills allow for a reduction of particle size down to ∼10–15 m. In addition to the improved particle size reduction, recent wet mill designs better maintain geometric consistency across the product line, thereby providing enhanced scalability. A traditional scale-up approach for wet milling involved maintaining the tip speed of the rotor  and would generally allow comparable terminal particle size  across scales. In order to predict the milling time upon scale-up the number of passes, or batch turnover, through the mill was kept constant. However, this prediction of the required milling time was often less successful than the prediction of the terminal particle size. Studies presented here confirmed the importance of maintaining constant rotor tip speed across scales to achieve the predicted terminal particle size and identified the importance of additional parameters to address particle breakage kinetics to allow prediction of the required milling time to achieve the target particle size. Additional aspects of hydrodynamics, shear rates, and equipment properties were assessed as part of these scale-up model optimization efforts. Specific processing parameters evaluated included flow rate, API slurry solids concentration, and starting particle size distribution. Ultimately, the Slot Event Model was developed to incorporate the critical geometric parameters by considering the frequency and the probability of a slot event. In addition to applying the revised model across scales, further model verification was achieved by evaluating custom rotor–stator mill heads. Studies with these custom mill heads provided insight into the importance of mill efficiency and slot events. This, in turn, allowed for more accurate scale-up of not only the terminal particle size but also the milling time required to achieve the target particle size. The success of the optimized model reduces the reliance on in-process controls or at-line testing for determining the end point of milling.',\n",

While these interactions reduce nonspecific adsorption of drug-loaded particles onto nontarget surfaces, they also inhibit internalization of particles into target cells. To circumvent this so-called “PEG-dilemma”, we have developed nanoparticles with a PEG coating that is shed after arrival in target tissue. Positively charged polycation nanoparticles were assembled with microRNA-34a via electrostatic interactions and then coated again via electrostatic interactions with an anionic PEG derivative that separates from the nanoparticle in the acidic tumor microenvironment. The resulting ternary nanoparticles with a sheddable shell have nearly neutral surface charge, which markedly reduces nonspecific adsorption. Shedding the PEG coat enhanced nanoparticle uptake into CD44-positive melanoma cells and promoted microRNA-34a release, which down-regulated CD44 expression and thereby inhibited tumor growth.

Marcus−Hush expressions were used to quantitatively relate structural differences between oxidation states to measured standard heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constants.

Among the NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 catalysts, NiSe shows the highest activity, exhibiting an overpotential of 389 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 93 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. We further report a facile preparation of nickel selenides nanocrystals  grown on MWCNTs. The NiSe/MWCNTs nanocomposite shows improved activity toward OER, with an overpotential of 336 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 78 mV/dec, which is close to the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The addition of MWCNTs during the synthesis not only introduces an abundance of nucleation sites, resulting in small particle sizes of NiSe crystals, but also improves the dispersion of NiSe nanoparticles. The small particle size and good dispersion of NiSe nanoparticles are beneficial to providing abundant active catalytic sites. In addition, the porous and conductive MWCNTs facilitate the electronic transmission and the electrolyte penetration. Furthermore, NiSe/MWCNTs nanocomposite also exhibits good long-term stability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This work is aimed at the analysis of the – stacking interactions as the driving force to develop porous supramolecular metal–organic frameworks  as an alternative to more directional hydrogen bonding interactions. Four compounds based on the interaction between rigid copper/adenine entities and theobromine/caffeine molecules have been synthesized: 2·∼28H2O , ·3Htheo·∼7H2O , ·2Htheo·∼18H2O , and ··∼6H2O . The blue compound 1 is formed by wheel-shaped cationic heptameric units where the copper atoms are bridged by hydroxide anions, water molecules, and adeninato ligands with a -N3:N9 coordination mode. The assembly of the heptameric entities and the theobrominate anions takes place mainly through – stacking interactions involving the adeninato ligands and theobrominate moieties. Although compound 1 exhibits an open-framework with voids representing 37% of the unit cell, the plasticity of the – interactions causes a reversible shrinkage of the porous system upon activation that precludes the adsorption of gas molecules. Dark purple compounds 2–4 contain neutral windmill units in which two copper atoms are bridged by four -N3:N9 adeninato ligands. Their final crystal structure highly depends on the supramolecular interactions of the theobromine and caffeine molecules. In compound 2, two theobromine molecules are hydrogen bonded to the Hoogsteen face of two trans-arranged adeninato ligands, whereas a third theobromine molecule is joined to the Watson–Crick face of one of the previous adeninato ligands. In compound 3, with a lower amount of theobromine, the Watson–Crick interaction is not present. In both compounds, the three-dimensional  crystal structure requires the additional presence of – stacks between the theobromine molecules. In compound 4, as the methyl groups of the caffeine molecule do not allow hydrogen bond interactions, the adeninato ligands are hydrogen bonded among them to generate, together with -stacking interactions, two-dimensional supramolecular sheets containing rectangular windows in which the caffeine molecules are located. Only compound 4 showed permanent porosity, adsorbing a significant amount of CO2 . The magnetic characterization of these compounds indicates a ferrimagnetic behavior for 1 and strong intradimeric antiferromagnetic interactions in compounds 2 and 4.',\n",

In the meantime, various nanotechnologies enable accommodation of the huge volume change of Si during charge/discharge processes, which significantly improves the performances of Si-based anodes. However, a large amount of binders and conductive agents are still required for the reliable performance of Si anodes. Herein, we have introduced free-standing Si electrodes, which show suppressed swelling property  after the 100th cycle in spite of no binders. Carbon-coated Si nanoparticle  via thermal decomposition of acetylene  gas was confined in the bundles of copper nanowires  that provide not only high electrical conductivity but also accommodation of volume changes of Si NPs. The carbon coating layer helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface  layer on the surface of Si NPs. Furthermore, two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide effectively combines Si NPs and Cu NWs, which maintains the electron pathway and structural stability of electrodes during cycling. As a result, the free-standing Si anodes showed high capacity  as well as long cycle stability , based on acceptable impedance data of lower charge transfer resistance  and higher diffusion coefficient . Our approach suggests that the formation of stable SEI layers and accommodation of volume expansion have to be considered together for high capacity and long cycling Si anodes.',\n",

The present study focuses on ultrafine Pt nanoparticles stabilized by flowerlike MoS2/N-doped reduced graphene oxide  architecture, developed via a facile and cost-competitive approach that was performed through the hydrothermal method followed by the wet-reflux strategy. Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy verified the conversion to 2/NrGO. 2/NrGO was applied as a potential electrocatalyst toward the anode reaction  and the cathode reaction . In the anode reaction, 2/NrGO showed superior activity toward electro-oxidation of methanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol with mass activities of 448.0, 158.0, and 147.0 mA/mgPt, respectively, approximately 4.14, 2.82, and 3.34 times that of a commercial Pt–C  catalyst. The durability of the 2/NrGO catalyst was tested via 500 potential cycles, demonstrating less than 20% of catalytic activity loss for alcohol fuels. In the cathode reaction, oxygen reduction reaction results showed excellent catalytic activity with higher half-wave potential at 0.895 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode for 2/NrGO. The durability of the 2/NrGO catalyst was tested via 30\\u2009000 potential cycles and showed only 15 mV reduction in the half-wave potential, whereas the  and Pt–C catalysts experienced a much greater shift .',\n",

A vibrational analysis of this transition shows a main progression in 640 cm-1, which is assigned as the N−H out-of-plane bending motion. The CIS-calculated equilibrium geometry of the S1 state indicates considerable distortion of the N atom relative to the C atoms.

       "  'abstract': 'This work features the controllability of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization  of methyl methacrylate, initiated by a multilayered 2-bromoisobutyryl moiety formed via diazonium chemistry. The thickness as a function of polymerization time has been studied by varying different parameters such as the bromine content of the initiator layer, polarity of reaction medium, ligand type , and the ratio of activator  to deactivator  in order to ascertain the controllability of the SI-ATRP process. The variation of thickness versus surface concentration of bromine shows a gradual transition from mushroom to brush-type conformation of the surface anchored chains in both polar and nonpolar reaction medium. Interestingly, it is revealed that very thick polymer brushes, on the order of 1 m, can be obtained at high bromine content of the initiator layer in toluene. The initial polymerization rate and the overall final thickness are higher in the case of nonpolar solvent  compared to polar medium . The ligand affects the initial rate of polymerization, which correlates with the redox potentials of the pertinent CuII/CuI complexes . It is also observed that the ability of polymer brushes to reinitiate depends on the initial thickness and the solvent used for generating it.',\n",

Two flavonoid compounds with Me2N- and Et2N-substituents were examined by acquiring their fluorescence at different temperatures, in order to evaluate the impact of intramolecular charge transfer  on ESIPT. By freezing the sample solution in liquid N2, the study detected the “locally excited” state at em ≈ 460 nm, in which both ICT and ESIPT processes were not present. As temperature was warmed up , ICT process became gradually allowed and emission was shifted to em ≈ 510 nm, which was attributed to the normal form N of flavonoid. Emission from tautomeric form T  could only be observed at a higher temperature, when ESIPT became allowed.

The calculations comprise a large number of, both singlet and triplet, valence and Rydberg excited states. A newly developed continuum model has been used to compute solvatochromic shifts. In the gas phase the first and second    excited singlet valence states of imidazole are computed at 6.72 and 7.15 eV, and they shift to 6.32 and 6.53 eV upon solvation. The gas-phase values are somewhat too large  due to an erroneous valence−Rydberg mixing in the CASSCF wave function. The first and second    excited singlet valence states of the imidazolium ion are computed at 5.72 and 6.94 eV in the gas phase and shifted to 5.86 and 6.83 eV in aqueous solutions. The present results are in agreement with the observed absorption band maxima in aqueous solution, 6.0 and 6.5 eV for imidazole and 6.0 and 6.9 eV for the imidazolium ion. The computed intensities suggest another possible  interpretation of the solution spectrum, where both species are simultaneously present. In this case the lowest band at 6.0 eV is assigned to a transition to the 2 1A1 state in protonated imidazole, while the second band observed in neutral solution at 6.5 eV corresponds to excitation to the 31A state in imidazole.

The solid-state structure of 3  reveals a parallelogram-shaped 2 core, with the overall molecule having approximate  C2 symmetry and a short intermetal separation  and 2.7809 Å). In contrast, the 1H NMR spectrum of 3  indicates overall C2v symmetry; this is likely due to cleavage of the phenyl bridges in solution. The solid-state structure of 4, which features the bulkier iPr-substituted ligand, reveals the absence of Ph bridges. Instead, each molecule of 4 has a pair of essentially noninteracting three-coordinate Zn centers. Benzene solutions of 3 react with 1 equiv of benzaldehyde to form the addition product MeLZn2  in 87% isolated yield. The solid-state structure of 5 reveals a symmetric and puckered 2 core with a short Zn−Zn separation of 2.6977 Å. In CD2Cl2 solution, the Ph bridge of 5 undergoes reversible cleavage. This process followed by rotation about the Zn−Ph bond leads to exchange of the inequivalent ortho  protons of the -Ph ligand. Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopic data indicates that this exchange occurs with ΔG⧧  11.5 kcal mol-1 . At 70 °C, benzene solutions of 5 react with 1 equiv of benzaldehyde to form the double-addition product MeLZn22  in 67% isolated yield.

       "  'abstract': \"Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin O  is a cytolytic toxin that binds to cholesterol-containing membranes and then self-associates to spontaneously form aqueous pores of varying size in the bilayer. In this study, a membrane-spanning domain has been identified in PFO by a combination of fluorescence spectroscopic methods using the fluorescent dye N,N-dimethyl-N--N-ethylenediamine  whose emission properties are sensitive to water. PFO was substituted with a single cysteine at most of the residues between amino acids K189 and N218, and then each cysteine was modified with NBD. Each purified NBD-labeled PFO was then bound to membranes, and the probe's environment was ascertained by measuring its fluorescence lifetime, emission intensity, and collisional quenching with either aqueous  or nonaqueous  quenchers. Lifetime and intensity measurements revealed that the amino acid side chains in this region of the membrane-bound PFO polypeptide alternated between being in an aqueous or a nonaqueous environment. This pattern indicates that this portion of the membrane-bound PFO spans the membrane in an antiparallel -sheet conformation. The alternating exposure of these residues to the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer was demonstrated by their susceptibility to quenching by nitroxide moieties attached to phospholipid acyl chains. Residues K189−N218 therefore form a two-stranded, amphipathic -sheet in the membrane-bound PFO that creates a stable interface between the pore and the membrane. This same region packs as three short -helices in the soluble, monomeric form of PFO, and therefore, the cholesterol-dependent conversion of PFO to a membrane-bound oligomer involves a major structural transition in which three -helices unfold to form a membrane-spanning amphipathic -sheet. \",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Results for the electrodeposition of platinum on carbon electrodes of nanometer size are presented. It is shown that electrodes with very small electroactive areas simplify the study of the nucleation and growth mechanism involved in electrodeposition. Reducing the electroactive area of the substrate easily controls the number of nucleation sites. With the use of substrates having electroactive radii of a few nanometers, it is possible to form only one single growth center and to allow that center to grow independently. The current transient associated with the growth of such a single nucleus provides both kinetic and mechanistic information about the electrodeposition process. A mathematical formula for the current transient under combined electrokinetic and mass-transport control based on the work of Fletcher  and Kruijt et al.  is used to fit the transients to extract the exchange current density and diffusion coefficient of the reactants. For the Pt on carbon deposition process at low overpotentials, for which the electron-transfer steps control the overall deposition process, single nucleation is observed when the electrode is smaller than about 5 nm in size. It is found that the single nucleation and growth processes can also occur at relatively large electrodes  when a high overpotential is applied so that a diffusion-controlled deposition process is established. Such a phenomenon is analyzed in terms of the depletion layer of electroactive species around the growing nucleus, and the effect that this has on the nucleation rate on the surrounding electrode surface.

       "  'abstract': 'While -aminobutyric acid  is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, suitable tools to measure its concentration in living cells with high spatiotemporal resolution are missing. Herein, we describe the first ratiometric fluorescent sensor for GABA, dubbed GABA-Snifit, which senses GABA with high specificity and spatiotemporal resolution on the surface of living mammalian cells. GABA-Snifit is a semisynthetic fusion protein containing the GABAB receptor, SNAP- and CLIP-tag, a synthetic fluorophore and a fluorescent GABAB receptor antagonist. When assembled on cell surfaces, GABA-Snifit displays a GABA-dependent fluorescence emission spectrum in the range of 500–700 nm that permits sensing micromolar to millimolar GABA concentrations. The ratiometric change of the sensor on living cells is 1.8. Furthermore, GABA-Snifit can be utilized to quantify the relative binding affinities of GABAB receptor agonists, antagonists and the effect of allosteric modulators. These properties make GABA-Snifit a valuable tool to investigate the role of GABA and GABAB in biological systems.',\n",

While such membranes are used in many applications, full utilization of the mechanical properties of nanofibrils has not been achieved in composite materials because of their random alignment. In the present research, aligned BC, in the form of arrays, has been developed through an optimally designed polydimethylsiloxane grating substrate placed at the air–liquid interface of the culture medium. The substrate prepared with the help of a 3-D printed mold served as an alignment template providing bacteria a preferred direction for BC growth. Additional alignment in BC arrays was obtained by stretching the hydrogel at a controlled strain rate and strain ratio. The degree of orientation, Young’s modulus, and tensile strength of aligned BC arrays increased by approximately 184, 409, and 256%, respectively, compared to the conventional BC pellicle. Such aligned BC arrays could open up future opportunities to design lightweight advanced “green” composites as alternatives to petroleum-based composites for a range of technical applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The goal of metabolomics is to measure the entire range of small organic molecules in biological samples. In liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, formidable analytical challenges remain in removing the nonbiological factors that affect chromatographic peak areas. These factors include sample matrix-induced ion suppression, chromatographic quality, and analytical drift. The combination of these factors is referred to as obscuring variation. Some metabolomics samples can exhibit intense obscuring variation due to matrix-induced ion suppression, rendering large amounts of data unreliable and difficult to interpret. Existing normalization techniques have limited applicability to these sample types. Here we present a data normalization method to minimize the effects of obscuring variation. We normalize peak areas using a batch-specific normalization process, which matches measured metabolites with isotope-labeled internal standards that behave similarly during the analysis. This method, called best-matched internal standard  normalization, can be applied to targeted or untargeted metabolomics data sets and yields relative concentrations. We evaluate and demonstrate the utility of B-MIS normalization using marine environmental samples and laboratory grown cultures of phytoplankton. In untargeted analyses, B-MIS normalization allowed for inclusion of mass features in downstream analyses that would have been considered unreliable without normalization due to obscuring variation. B-MIS normalization for targeted or untargeted metabolomics is freely available at https://github.com/IngallsLabUW/B-MIS-normalization.',\n",

No gelation was observed in pure solvents employed. All the amphiphilic molecules were found to form stable organogels in the solvents in the presence of a small amount of water, methanol, or urea. The volume of solvent gelled by a given amount of the gelator was observed to depend upon the volume of added water. The gelation behavior of the amphiphiles in a given solvent containing a known volume of water was compared. The effects of chirality and substitution on the acid group on the gelation ability were examined. Although the corresponding N--dl-alanine was found to form only weak organogel in pure solvents, the achiral amphiphilic compound N---alanine, however, did not form gel in the absence of water. The methyl ester of N--l-alanine was also observed to form gels in the same solvents, but only in the presence of water. The organogels were characterized by several techniques, including 1H NMR, Fourier transform IR, X-ray diffraction, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The thermal and rheological properties of the organogels were studied. The mechanical strength of the organogel formed by N--dl-alanine was observed to increase upon the addition of water. It was concluded that water-mediated intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction between amphiphiles caused formation of supramolecular self-assemblies.',\n",

Under oxygen-deficient condition, MgxZn1–xO thin film deposited mainly along  orientation of cubic structure lattice at temperature below 350 °C because of the alternatively constituted substrate surface by Si and O atoms and the weak horizontal migration of reactive atoms, mix-constituted substrate surface and the intense horizontal migration of reactive atoms introduced phase separation in MgxZn1–xO thin films deposited at higher temperature. Single cubic structure  Mg0.38Zn0.62O thin films was made at 300 °C with Zn composition over theoretical limit in bulk materials, the band gap of which reached 4.2 eV and the MgZnO thin film could detect 330 nm near-UV light. And the available UV range of the cubic MgxZn1–xO thin film deposited at 350 °C was widened to 348 nm near-UV light because of the cubic MgZnO grains with even higher Mg composition in this sample. Under high temperature and oxygen flow rate condition, MgxZn1–xO thin film deposited mainly along the  orientation of cubic structure lattice at 2 Pa pressure, MgxZn1–xO thin film deposited mainly along the  orientation of cubic structure lattice on O-rich substrate surface when the migration energy of reactive atoms is extremely small at 10 Pa oxygen pressure, and both mix-constituted substrate surface and medium migration energy of reactive atoms cause the phase separation occurred in MgxZn1–xO thin films deposited under medium oxygen pressure. On the basis of the different substrate surface atom constitution and different migration characteristics of reactive atoms considering particular deposition method and condition, some previous results on the formation of different structure MgxZn1–xO thin films and phase separation could also be interpreted. So the available UV range of cubic MgZnO thin film could be adjusted widely from near-UV  to vacuum UV  range when both substrate surface atom constitution and migration characteristics of reactive atoms are suitable under given condition by multiple methods.',\n",

With the use of this comprehensive approach, we were able to clearly distinguish a clinical isolate of MTB from a nonTB species of the genus Mycobacterium avium grown in liquid culture media.

This review will use a SWOT analysis model to discuss some of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that are apparent to an investigator venturing into this relatively new field. SWOT has been used extensively in business settings to uncover new outlooks and identify problems that would impede progress. The field of environmental metabolomics provides great opportunities for discovery, and this is recognized by a high level of interest in potential applications. However, understanding the biological consequence of environmental exposures can be confounded by inter- and intra-individual differences. Metabolomic profiles can yield a plethora of data, the interpretation of which is complex and still being evaluated and researched. The development of the field will depend on the availability of technologies for data handling and that permit ready access metabolomic databases. Understanding the relevance of metabolomic endpoints to organism health vs adaptation vs variation is an important step in understanding what constitutes a substantive environmental threat. Metabolomic applications in reproductive research are discussed. Overall, the development of a comprehensive mechanistic-based interpretation of metabolomic changes offers the possibility of providing information that will significantly contribute to the protection of human health and the environment.

Here, we designed and synthesized a set of SIRT defatty-acylase activity probes with various quencher moieties and peptide sequences based on our previously developed one-step FRET-based SIRT probe SFP3, using improved methodology. Scanning of this set of probes with SIRT isozymes revealed that certain probe/isozyme combinations showed especially high responses. To illustrate the utility of the combinations thus identified, we applied compound 18/SIRT2 for inhibitor screening of a large chemical library. This enabled us to discover a new small molecule SIRT2-specific defatty-acylase inhibitor.',\n",

The nuclease hypersensitivity element III1  of the c-MYC promoter can form transcriptionally active and silenced forms, and the formation of DNA G-quadruplex structures has been shown to be critical for c-MYC transcriptional silencing. The solution structure of a 2:1 quindoline–G-quadruplex complex has been solved and shows unexpected features, including the drug-induced reorientation of the flanking sequences to form a new binding pocket. While both 3′ and 5′ complexes show overall similar features, there are identifiable differences that emphasize the importance of both stacking and electronic interactions. For the first time, we describe the importance of the shape of the ligand as well as the two flanking bases in determining drug binding specificity. These structures provide important insights for the structure-based rational design of drugs that bind to unimolecular parallel G-quadruplexes commonly found in promoter elements.',\n",

DSSCs based on a TNWG hybrid photoanode with a reduced graphene oxide content of 8 wt % demonstrated an overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 4.95%, accompanied by a short-circuit current density of 10.41 mA cm–2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.71 V, and a fill factor of 67%, which were much higher than those of DSSC made with a pure TiO2-B NW-based photoanode. The overall improvement in photovoltaic performance could be associated to the intense visible light absorption and enhanced dye adsorption because of the increased surface area of the composite, together with faster electron transport due to reduced carrier recombination.',\n",

Irradiation of those bis compounds generated bis, which were characterized by ESR and UV−vis spectroscopic techniques in a matrix at low temperature, as well as time-resolved UV−vis spectroscopy in solution at room temperature. These studies revealed that both of the bis, 3 and 4, have a singlet quinoidal diradical ground state with a very small singlet−triplet energy gap of less than 1 kcal/mol. A remarkable increase in the lifetime of bis as opposed to that of monocarbene  was noted and was interpreted to indicate that bis are thermodynamically stabilized as a result of delocalization of unpaired electrons throughout a -net framework. Despite the stability, both bis are readily trapped by molecular oxygen to afford bis as main products. ',\n",

Isomerization at C17 in 2, due to intraTTET, is reduced  but not completely eliminated by the endocyclic alkene in ring B, which functions as a “triplet gate”. The exocyclic methylene group in 3b is more efficient in gating the intraTTET than it is in 3a . This higher level of gating that occurs in 3b is attributed to a much shorter lifetime of the axial DPSO triplet, caused by an efficient through-space intraTTET from the axial DPSO group to the C6 exocyclic olefin.

       "  'abstract': 'The kinetics of the reaction of a series of aromatic and aliphatic thiols with cluster 1 were determined. These reactions form cluster 2 and the arene or alkane corresponding to the thiol:\\u2009 Cp2Mo2Co2S34   RSH  Cp2Mo2Co2S42   RH  2CO. These reactions are first order in thiol and first order in cluster 1 with appreciable negative entropies of activation. These data suggest that the rate determining step of the desulfurization reaction is the initial association of the thiol to the cluster. The more nucleophilic thiolate anions react with 1 at −40 °C to form an adduct in which the thiolate anion is bound 1 to the Co atom. At −25 °C, the initial adduct rearranges to a fluxional 2, 1-bound thiolate. The fluxional process is proposed to involve a concerted “walking” of the thiolate and a 2-bound sulfide ligand on the surface of the cluster. Near 35 °C, the thiolate−cluster adduct undergoes C−S bond homolysis to give the paramagnetic anion of cluster 1 and the phenyl or alkyl radical. The radical nature of the C−S bond cleavage was confirmed by the desulfurization of the radical clock reagents, cyclopropylmethanethiol and -thiolate anion, that form the cyclopropylmethyl radical which rearranged to the butenyl radical. The possible similarity in the C−S bond cleavage mechanism in these desulfurization reactions to those occurring in hydrodesulfurization  over Co/Mo/S catalysts is discussed. ',\n",

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the relevance of pH for PTH–penetratin conjugates and coadministered penetratin with PTH regarding transepithelial permeation of PTH and cellular effects. Transepithelial permeation was assessed using monolayers of the Caco-2 cell culture model, and effects on Caco-2 cellular viability kinetics were evaluated by using the Real-Time-GLO assay as well as by microscopy following Tryphan blue staining. Morphological Caco-2 cell changes were studied exploiting the impedance-based xCELLigence system as well as optically using the oCelloscope setup. Finally, the effect of pH on the folding propensity of the PTH–penetratin conjugate and its ability to disrupt lipid membranes were assessed by circular dichroism  spectroscopy and the calcein release assay, respectively. The transepithelial PTH permeation was not pH-dependent when applying the coadministration approach. However, by applying the conjugation approach, the PTH permeation was significantly enhanced by lowering the pH from 7.4 to 5 but also associated with a compromised barrier and a lowering of the cellular viability. The negative effects on the cellular viability following cellular incubation with the PTH–penetratin conjugate were moreover confirmed during real-time monitoring of the Caco-2 cell viability as well as by enhanced Tryphan blue uptake. In addition, morphological changes were primarily observed for cells incubated with the PTH–penetratin conjugate at pH 5, which was moreover demonstrated to have an enhanced membrane permeating effect following lowering of the pH from 7.4 to 5. The latter observation was, however, not a result of better secondary folding propensity at pH 5 when compared to pH 7.4.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mechanism of ionic recognition by polymer-supported reagents is probed with cross-linked polystyrene modified with tetramethylmalonamide  ligands. The substrates are lanthanide ions in 0.001−8 M HCl and HNO3 solutions. The results fall into three regions of acid concentration: low, mid, and high. In HCl, distribution coefficients are low in 0.001 to 2 M, increase in 4 and 6 M, and then decrease in 8 M HCl. In the low-acid region, the metal ion remains with its waters of hydration and does not coordinate to the carbonyl oxygens. As the acid concentration exceeds 2 M, protonation of the amide occurs to form an iminium moiety, electrostatically attracting the anionic lanthanide complex through ion-exchange and releasing waters of hydration. At high acid concentration, the apparent affinity decreases due to competition by the large excess of chloride ions for the ion-exchange sites. The affinity sequence in 6 M HCl is Tb &gt; Dy &gt; Eu &gt; Gd &gt; Ho &gt; Sm &gt; Er &gt; Tm &gt; Yb &gt; Lu &gt; Nd &gt; Ce &gt; La. The TMMA−Ln interaction is due to recognition since there is a point of maximum affinity across the series rather than a monotonic trend. The trends are comparable in HNO3. A comparison of the distribution coefficients at the maxima  shows nitrate to have greater values than chloride due to a hydration effect, as also indicated by results from H2SO4.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to develop a rapid method for extracting tea catechins from human plasma samples with a solid-phase extraction technique and to subsequently measure their concentrations using an HPLC system. A human plasma sample spiked with known concentrations of the analyte standards was passed through a Waters Oasis HLB cartridge. After repeated washing, tea catechins were eluted with 70% dimethylformamide containing 0.1% phosphoric acid, and the resulting eluate was injected into an HPLC system. Analytes were separated on a reverse-phase C18 column using an isocratic mobile phase and detected electrochemically. The coefficient of variation for inter- and intraday reproducibility was less than 5.0% and 6.4%, respectively. Linearity was established for the concentration range of 0.01−1.0 M. The method was successfully applied to measure tea catechin concentrations in the plasma of two healthy subjects who received a single ingestion of a green tea beverage. The proposed method enables the rapid and accurate quantitation of plasma tea catechins and might prove useful for the evaluation of beneficial health effects of tea consumption. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The molecular interactions between the surfaces of cocrystals  and the polymers  were investigated through combined experimental and molecular dynamics simulation approaches to resolve the mechanisms of cocrystal dissolution and precipitation. It was found that adsorption of the polymers on the surfaces of cocrystals might prevent the precipitation of the parent drug and alter the dissolution rate. The effect of polymers on precipitation could be determined by the cocrystal dissolution rate, the interactions of polymers with the surfaces of cocrystals, the characters of the noncovalent bonds formed between the polymers and the cocrystal surfaces, and the mobility and conformation of the polymers. The etching experiments of single cocrystals revealed that FFA-NIC and CBZ-NIC appeared as surface precipitation cocrystals while FFA-TP could lead to bulk precipitation. Both PVP and PVP-VA were good precipitation inhibitors for FFA-NIC, and they could completely inhibit the recrystallization of FFA III on the surfaces of dissolving cocrystals. In addition, as the adsorption of the polymer was slower than dissolution rate of the cocrystals, PVP and PVP-VA could only partially inhibit the recrystallization of CBZ dihydrate on the surface of CBZ-NIC. While PEG had no inhibitory effect on the surface crystallization of FFA-NIC and CBZ-NIC, due to its weak interactions with the surfaces of the cocrystals, it enhanced the dissolution performance of FFA-TP. In contrast, PVP and PVP-VA reduced the dissolution rate of FFA-TP and subsequently undermined the performance of cocrystals. Taken together, the approach of combining experimental and molecular dynamics simulation provided insights into the mechanisms of cocrystal dissolution as well as the polymers acting as inhibitory excipients for precipitation/recrystallization, making contribution to the development of novel formulations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Determination of equivalence classes of atoms in molecules and the unique numbering for the molecular graphs are of major interest for many structure processing tasks and many programs have been reported for this purpose. Most of them were based on the use of graph invariants, but such methods reportedly failed to give correct partitioning for certain structures and the only theoretically rigorous method is based on atom-by-atom matchings1 which was considered to be computationally impractical. In order to avoid the failures of partitioning and the time-consuming atom-by-atom matching, on the basis of a profound analysis on the mechanism of Morgan algorithm, this work proposed two improvements for the original Morgan algorithm. The first improvement is to avoid the oscillatory behavior of Morgan algorithm. The second improvement referred to as single-vertex Morgan algorithm, is to decompose the Morgan algorithm into single-vertex processing. By incorporating these improvements, an effective topological symmetry perception and unique numbering algorithms were devised. The high performance of these algorithms is demonstrated with some graphs that are difficult to partition. ',\n",

This coupling may in turn be linked to an extended -conjugated organic functional group. The major interaction is akin to the so-called back-bonding in metal carbonyl complexes.

To investigate such film formation mechanism, we performed the atomistic reaction simulations in acetonitrile -based electrolyte solutions using the Red Moon method /molecular dynamics  reaction method). The present simulations were able to successfully reproduce the experimental observations where the reaction products produced by the reduction of salts mainly form the SEI film in the HC electrolyte. Further, it was revealed that such stable SEI film can be formed in a stepwise fashion:  the diffusive transfer of reduction products,  the Li salt-based passivation film formation, and  the formation of the solvent-based film layer.

This reaction provides capped oligoribonucleotides, which function as primers for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. The endonuclease reaction is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. We have used a number of divalent and trivalent metal ions alone and in combination to probe the mechanism of RNA cleavage by the influenza virus endonuclease. Virus-specific cleavage was observed with various metal ions, and maximum cleavage activity was obtained with 100 M Mn2 or 100 M Co2. This activity was about 2-fold higher than that observed with Mg2 at the optimal concentration of 1 mM. Activity dependence on metal ion concentration was cooperative with Hill coefficients close to or larger than 2. Synergistic activation of cleavage activity was observed with combinations of different metal ions at varying concentrations. These results support a two-metal ion mechanism of RNA cleavage for the influenza virus cap-dependent endonuclease. The findings are also consistent with a structural model of the polymerase, in which the specific endonuclease active site is spatially separated from the nucleotidyl transferase active site of the polymerase module.

Taken together with our previously reported results, these data further confirm our idea that cellular alterations induced by NNRTIs are a consequence of the inhibition of the endogenous reverse transcriptase in A375 cells and support the potential of NNRTIs as valuable agents in cancer therapy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accurate knowledge of the compositions of the equilibrium phases in the systems containing gas hydrates is essential for many hydrate-based separation processes. Unfortunately, there are limited sets of such experimental data available in the literature partly due to the difficulties in measurements of the compositions of the phases in equilibrium with gas hydrate. Consequently, satisfactory accuracy of the measurements may not be obvious. Therefore, reliability of the corresponding data should be checked prior to their further applications. In this article, we present a thermodynamic assessment test  based on the area test approach for the experimental compositional data of vapor phase in equilibrium with gas hydrate  liquid water for the carbon dioxide  methane or nitrogen  water system. The van der Waals and Platteeuw  solid solution theory is used to model the hydrate phase, and the Valderrama–Patel–Teja equation of state  along with the nondensity dependent  mixing rule is applied to deal with the fluid phases. The results show that only one of the studied experimental data sets seems to be thermodynamically consistent, and the rest of the data seem to be either not fully consistent or inconsistent.',\n",

In this work, we have studied the influence of the operating parameters on the selective catalytic reduction of NO by propylene over a characterized Cu-ion-exchanged titanium-pillared interlayer clays . NO reduction was favored by a C3H6 concentration increase when the combustion of this hydrocarbon was complete. NO reduction was observed to be promoted by a small amount of oxygen when the oxygen concentration was less than that required for complete C3H6 combustion . For oxygen concentrations higher than this critical value, the effect of oxygen concentration was different, depending on the reaction temperature, compared to that corresponding to the maximum NO conversion. Two different rate-limiting steps exist in the SCR−NO, when Cu-Ti-PILCs are used as catalysts, depending on the reaction temperature:\\u2009 surface reaction control at low temperatures and external mass-transfer control at high temperatures.

       "  'abstract': 'Mechanochemical reactions between adsorbate molecules sheared at tribological interfaces can induce association of adsorbed molecules, forming oligomeric and polymeric products often called tribopolymers). This study revealed the role or effect of surface chemistry of the solid substrate in mechanochemical polymerization reactions. As a model reactant, -pinene was chosen because it was known to readily form tribopolymers at the sliding interface of stainless steel under vapor-phase lubrication conditions. Eight different substrate materials were tested—palladium, nickel, copper, stainless steel, gold, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, and diamond-like carbon . All metal substrates and DLC were initially covered with surface oxide species formed naturally in air or during the oxidative sample cleaning. It was found that the tribopolymerization yield of -pinene is much higher on the substrates that can chemisorb -pinene, compared to the ones on which only physisorption occurs. From the load dependence of the tribopolymerization yield, it was found that the surfaces capable of chemisorption give a smaller critical activation volume for the mechanochemical reaction, compared to the ones capable of physisorption only. On the basis of these observations and infrared spectroscopy analyses of the adsorbed molecules and the produced polymers, it was concluded that the mechanochemical reaction mechanisms might be different between chemically reactive and inert surfaces and that the chemical reactivity of the substrate surface greatly influences the tribochemical polymerization reactions of adsorbed molecules.',\n",

Polymers with different cluster loadings exhibit the characteristic broad band emission of Mo6Cl12 at max  765 ± 3 nm, and luminescence decays are composed of short- and long-lifetime components, which are consistent with the presence of cis- and trans-disubstituted cluster species, respectively. The lifetime of the cis form is too short to permit its bimolecular reaction with oxygen. However, the long-lifetime component is quenched efficiently by O2, and Stern−Volmer analyses of emission lifetimes yield quenching rate constants of  × 105 M-1 s-1 for cluster loadings in the range  × 10-3 g/g of PVP, respectively. The quenching rate constant increases to ∼50 × 105 M-1 s-1 for all polymers in MeOH regardless of cluster loading. In aqueous solutions  intermediate quenching rate constants are observed. These results correlate with the swelling properties of the PVP polymer in various solvents where greater swelling is manifested in greater accessibility of oxygen to the cluster active site and hence increased quenching rate constants. Oxygenated solutions of PVP-Mo6Cl12 and alkenes photoreact to yield oxidized olefins. The products and product distributions indicate an energy transfer quenching reaction between oxygen and electronically excited polymer-bound clusters to produce singlet oxygen. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Specific ranges of dissolved oxygen  concentrations must be maintained in a waterbody for it to be hospitable for aquatic animals. DO sensor designs can employ selectively permeable membranes to isolate DO from untargeted compounds or organisms in waterbodies. Hence, the DO concentration can be monitored and the health of the water can be evaluated over time. However, the presence of bacteria in natural waterbodies can lead to the formation of biofilms that can block pores and prevent analyte from permeating the membrane, resulting in inaccurate readings. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of a fluorosilane-based omniphobic lubricant-infused  coating on a selectively permeable membrane and investigate the rate of biofilm formation for a commercially available DO sensor. Coated and unmodified membranes were incubated in an environment undergoing accelerated bacterial growth, and the change in sensitivity was evaluated after 40, 100, 250, and 500 h. Our findings show that the OLI membranes attenuate biofouling by 70% and maintain sensitivity after 3 weeks of incubation, further demonstrating that oxygen transfer through the OLI coating is achievable. Meanwhile, unmodified membranes exhibit significant biofouling that results in a 3.35 higher rate of decay in oxygen measurement sensitivity and an over 70% decrease in static contact angle. These results show that the OLI coating can be applied on commercially available membranes to prevent biofouling. Therefore, OLI coatings are a suitable candidate to suppress biofilm formation in the widespread use of selectively permeable membranes for environmental, medical, and fluid separation applications.',\n",

It has been known for some time that carbonic acid can be separated from strong acids by ion chromatography in the exclusion mode  using only water as the eluent. The practice of water ICE was shown feasible for very weak acids like silicate and borate with a dedicated element specific detector like an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer , but this is rarely practical in most laboratories. Direct conductometric detection is possible for H2CO3 but because of its weak nature, not especially sensitive; complex multistep ion exchange methods do not markedly improve this LOD. It will clearly be impractical in acids that are weaker still. By using a permeative amine introduction device  as a conductometric developing agent, we demonstrate that a variety of weak acids  cannot only be separated on an ion exclusion column, they can be sensitively detected . We observe that the elution order is essentially the same as that on a nonfunctionalized poly column using 1–10% acetonitrile as eluent and follows the reverse order of the polar surface area  of the analyte molecules. PSA values have been widely used to predict biological transport of pharmaceuticals across a membrane but never to predict chromatographic behavior. We demonstrate the application of the technique by measuring the silicate and borate depth profiles in the Pacific Ocean; the silicate results show an excellent match with results from a reference laboratory.',\n",

Chronic constant light exposure effectively disrupts circadian rhythm in rats. On the basis of previous publications, we hypothesized that chronic constant light exposure might contribute significantly to development of AD-like-phenotype in rats and that fluoxetine  treatment might protect the brain against it. Adult male rats were exposed to normal light-dark cycles, constant light , constant dark, and LLFlx  for four months. The expression of molecular markers of circadian rhythm: Per2 transcripts; and protein expression of peroxiredoxin-1  and hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins  were significantly dysregulated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei  of LL rats, which was prevented with concomitant fluoxetine administration. The levels of glutamate and -aminobutyric acid were dysregulated, and oxidative damage was observed in the SCN and hippocampi of LL rats. Fluoxetine treatment conferred protection against oxidative damage in LL rats. Constant light exposure also impaired rats’ performance on Y-maze, Morris maze, and novel object recognition test, which was prevented with fluoxetine administration. A significant elevation in soluble A1–42 levels, which strongly correlated with upregulation of Bace1 and Mgat3 transcripts was observed in the hippocampus of LL rats. Further, the expression of antiaging gene Sirt1 was downregulated, and neuronal damage indicator Prokr2 was upregulated in hippocampus. Fluoxetine rescued A1–42 upregulation and AD-related genes’ dysregulation. Our findings show that circadian disruption by exposure to chronic constant light may contribute to progression of AD, which can be prevented with fluoxetine treatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The goal of this study was to investigate three potential ways that the soluble organic nitrogen  fraction of wastewater treatment plant  effluents, termed effluent organic N , could contribute to coastal eutrophication - direct biological removal, photochemical release of labile compounds, and salinity-mediated release of ammonium . Effluents from two WWTPs were used in the experiments. For the bioassays, EON was added to water from four salinities  collected from the James River  in August 2008, and then concentrations of N and phosphorus compounds were measured periodically over 48 h. Bioassay results, based on changes in DON concentrations, indicate that some fraction of the EON was removed and that the degree of EON removal varied between effluents and with salinity. Further, we caution that bioassay results should be interpreted within a broad context of detailed information on chemical characterization. EON from both WWTPs was also photoreactive, with labile NH4 and dissolved primary amines released during exposure to sunlight. We also present the first data that demonstrate that when EON is exposed to higher salinities, increasing amounts of NH4 are released, further facilitating EON use as effluent transits from freshwater through estuaries to the coast.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Thermal atomic layer etching  of amorphous Al2O3 was performed by alternate exposures of niobium pentafluoride  and carbon tetrachloride . The ALEt of Al2O3 is observed at temperatures from 380 to 460 °C. The etched thickness and the etch rate were determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and verified by X-ray reflectivity. The maximum etch rate of about 1.4 Å/cycle and a linear increase of the removed film thickness with the number of etch cycles were obtained at a temperature of 460 °C. With the help of density functional theory calculations, an etch mechanism is proposed where NbF5 converts part of the Al2O3 surface into an AlF3 or aluminum oxyfluoride layer, which upon reacting with CCl4 is converted into volatile halide-containing byproducts, thus etching away the converted portion of the material. Consistent with this, a significant surface fluorine content of about 55 at. % was revealed when the elemental depth profile analysis of a thick NbF5-treated Al2O3 layer was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface morphology of the reference, pre-, and postetch Al2O3 surfaces was analyzed using atomic force microscopy and bright-field transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, it is found that this process chemistry is able to etch Al2O3 selectively over silicon dioxide  and silicon nitride .',\n",

Exposure of 2 to solvents containing trace water results in the conversion to the dinuclear SmIII complex, Sm22I4. Structural analysis of both complexes shows substantial rearrangement of the crown ether from a folded, Pac-Man form with SmII to a twisted conformation with SmIII. The optical properties of 2 exhibit a strong temperature dependence and change from broad-band absorption features indicative of domination by 5d states to fine features characteristic of 4f  4f transitions at low temperatures. Examination of the electronic structure of these complexes via ab initio wave function calculations  shows that the ground state of SmII in 2 is a 4f6 state with low-lying 4f55d1 states, where the latter states have been lowered in energy by ∼12\\u202f000 cm–1 with respect to the free ion. The decacoordination of the SmII cation by the crown ether is responsible for this alteration in the energies of the excited state and demonstrates the ability to tune the electronic structure of SmII.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We have studied theoretically the effects of counterion-membrane-fixed ion pairing on the Donnan equilibrium in charged membranes with low dielectric constant regions. First, the formal relationship between the ionic activity coefficients in the membrane and the membrane effective charge concentration is established by comparing the results obtained from a model based on the ideal Donnan equilibrium extended to account for the ion pairing effect with the results obtained from a thermodynamic formalism including ionic activities instead of concentrations. Second, we calculate the membrane effective charge concentration and the ionic activity coefficients by using a simple model of ion pairing based on the Fuoss approach for contact ion pairs in electrolyte solutions with a correction term for the entropy change of the counterion undergoing ion pairing. Finally, we study the activity coefficients effects on the co-ion exclusion in the charged membrane as a function of the external salt concentration. Though it seems established that membrane inhomogeneity is the mainly responsible for the deviations from the ideal Donnan equilibrium observed experimentally in charged membranes, the theoretical approach presented here can be useful for those cases where conclusive experimental evidence for ion pairing exists.

Transmissive, magneto-optical materials of sufficient thickness can achieve large Faraday rotation angles, where the intrinsic magneto-optical activity of a substance is described by the Verdet constant of the material. High Verdet constant materials are critical for a wide range of magneto-optical devices, such as optical isolators, optical circulators, and modulators. State of the art in Faraday rotation devices such as optical isolators most widely employs inorganic garnet materials, which possess excellent optical transparency and robust thermomechanical properties. However, these materials possess fairly low Verdet constants . In this report, we demonstrate the use of polymer-coated magnetic cobalt nanoparticles  to afford ultrahigh Verdet constant materials  with 2–3 orders of magnitude greater Verdet constants than classical inorganic garnets and earlier polymer-magnetic NP materials. Furthermore, the polymer coating on magnetic NPs affords excellent colloidal dispersion that enables solution or melt processing of these materials into multilayered thin films or free-standing films. The ability to prepare CoNPs of varying sizes further enabled structure–property correlations of magnetic NP size with both bulk magnetic and magnetic-optical properties, which previously has not been conducted.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The recently prepared 3-propargyl complex   exhibits unusual regioselectivity in reactions involving nucleophilic addition to the propargyl ligand. Fenske−Hall approximate molecular orbital calculations and density functional calculations have been carried out to study the structure, bonding, and reactivity of 1. The calculations suggest that the principal bonding interaction between Pt and the propargyl ligand occurs through the terminal carbon atoms of the ligand, despite the observed short Pt−central carbon distance. Optimized geometries for model complexes calculated by density functional methods agree well with the reported crystal structure of 1. The observed nucleophilic addition to the central carbon of the propargyl ligand is suggested to occur through a charge-controlled mechanism, assisted by the presentation of a low-lying acceptor orbital on the central carbon along the reaction path.

       "  'abstract': 'In the Co-catalyzed hydrolytic kinetic resolution  of terminal epoxides, the rate- and stereoselectivity-determining epoxide ring-opening step occurs by a cooperative bimetallic mechanism with one Co complex acting as a Lewis acid and another serving to deliver the hydroxide nucleophile. In this paper, we analyze the basis for the extraordinarily high stereoselectivity and broad substrate scope observed in the HKR. We demonstrate that the stereochemistry of each of the two Co complexes in the rate-determining transition structure is important for productive catalysis: a measurable rate of hydrolysis occurs only if the absolute stereochemistry of each of these Co complexes is the same. Experimental and computational studies provide strong evidence that stereochemical communication in the HKR is mediated by the stepped conformation of the salen ligand, and not the shape of the chiral diamine backbone of the ligand. A detailed computational analysis reveals that the epoxide binds the Lewis acidic Co complex in a well-defined geometry imposed by stereoelectronic rather than steric effects. This insight serves as the basis of a complete stereochemical and transition structure model that sheds light on the reasons for the broad substrate generality of the HKR.',\n",

The adsorption amounts of DBTO2 over both adsorbents were enhanced compared to the DBT adsorption amounts, which clearly demonstrated that a combination of oxidation and adsorption is better than direct adsorption to achieve a better desulfurization performance. Besides, it was found that CMK-3 performed better for DBT removal compared to MCM-41, but the adsorption amount of DBTO2 over MCM-41 exceeded the corresponding value over CMK-3 . Moreover, model fuels with varied hydrocarbon compositions were employed to investigate the impact of arene amounts. Finally, jet and diesel fuels were oxidized and treated with MCM-41, resulting in 85.6% and 81.4% sulfur removal, respectively. In contrast, when the fuels were directly treated with MCM-41, the corresponding sulfur removal amounts were only 19.8% and 40.9%. The results with real fuels further verified the necessity of the oxidation process. A simple washing method was found to be effective for regeneration of the adsorbent.',\n",

Biochemical studies showed an improved storage stability of the immobilized pectinase as well as enhanced performance at higher temperatures and over a wider pH range.

The kinetics of a model reaction catalyzed by the immobilized pectinase was finally investigated by the Michaelis−Menten equation. The PSStNa support presents a very simple, mild, and time-saving process for enzyme immobilization, and this strategy of immobilizing pectinase also makes use of expensive enzymes economically viable, strengthening repeated use of them as catalysts following their rapid and easy separation with a magnet.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Organic–inorganic hybrid membranes, made of a high density of redox active moieties covalently bonded to the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesoporous silica thin films, are relevant for applications in transparent energy storage devices. This is demonstrated here on the basis of functionalized transparent mesoporous silica thin films prepared on the indium–tin oxide electrode from the combination of an electrochemically induced self-assembly method  and a copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne click reaction . The very small thickness  and the uniformly distributed vertical mesochannels with ultranarrow diameter  make the hybrid film a promising substrate that not only achieves a transparency of 82% but also provides large surface area to accommodate a high density of redox active species such as ferrocene. In such rigid and insulating porous membranes, the charge transfer reactions take place through a pure electron-hopping mechanism between adjacent redox sites, which are favored by the ordered and oriented mesostructure containing large amounts of uniformly distributed ferrocene functions in the mesochannels. Their performance results from both high charge transfer rates  and easy mass transport . The most effective system is the ferrocene-functionalized silica film prepared from 40% organosilane, which is able to deliver a capacity of 105 C cm–3  at a current density of 0.4 A cm–3 . Such an electrode can be associated to an electrodeposited graphene anode in a solid-state battery–capacitor hybrid device, which can deliver 0.74 mC cm–2 at a potential scan rate of 20 mV s–1. The azide-functionalized mesoporous silica film is actually a versatile platform that can be functionalized with different redox molecules, as shown here for cobaltocenium moieties, which may broaden its application field.',\n",

Our results show that maximum adsorption capacities of Cd2, Ni2, and Zn2 ions, at 30 °C and pH 5, may increase up to 15 times, with respect to the results obtained using the commercial adsorbent without modification.

This control was assumed to be feasible through the photochemical isomerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene  to cis-1,3,5-hexatriene . 1,3-CHD was present in a molar concentration of 1% in a PRF fuel and was transformed into 1,3,5-HT in varying amounts prior to ignition, in an attempt to control autoignition timing. The autoignition delays were calculated using a newly developed chemical kinetic mechanism for the low temperature combustion of PRF/1,3-CHD/1,3,5-HT mixtures in air. Validations for  PRF/air mixtures were performed by simulations based on the new mechanism developed in the current work against ignition delay times  of the literature measured in rapid compression machines. The agreement between simulations and experiments for the pure compounds reinforced the accuracy of the mechanism, which led to an investigation of its impact on the IDTs for the addition of 1,3-CHD to PRF90. The computations showed that 1,3-CHD was an ignition enhancer, with a similar boosting effect to that of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate. Simulations predicted that the extent of ignition enhancing of 1,3-CHD can be controlled by the pressure because of the specific combustion chemistry that rules the ignition enhancing capacity of this compound. Additions of 1,3-CHD were found to promote the reactivity of a PRF90 to a greater extent than the addition of 1,3,5-HT. Simple single-zone modeling showed that ignition in a homogeneous charge compression ignition  engine may be controlled if the fuel is photochemically isomerized using light-irradiation prior to the combustion process.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For more than half a century the theoretical landscape for single chain dynamics for dense polymeric solutions and melts below the entanglement threshold has been dominated by the Rouse model for independent phantom chains, supported by ideas of hydrodynamic screening. There exists, however, a large body of literature from experiments, Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations on the deviations from the Rouse behavior for unentangled homopolymer melts, showcased mostly in the subdiffusive behavior of center-of-mass of tagged chains at intermediate times, with the subdiffusion exponent reported in the range 0.75–0.85. The influence of the surrounding chains of length Ns on the motion of a single tagged chain of length N is a key test, by which, through high-precision numerical simulation of unentangled melts, we show that the Rouse model fails. Our central results are that at intermediate times the tagged chain’s center-of-mass moves subdiffusively, ⟨Δr2cm⟩ ∝ t with subdiffusion exponent   0.87 ± 0.03 as opposed to Rouse  1, and that its crossover time to Fickian behavior is directly controlled by the relaxation time of the surrounding chains when the latter are shorter. The terminal relaxation time for the tagged chain and the long time diffusion coefficient are then sensitive to Ns. Both measured exponent flow, that is plots of d/d ln  vs  where  is the effective exponent between ⟨Δr2cm⟩ and t, and successful blob scaling arguments support the anomalous value of  as a true exponent. We find the same exponent in the scaling of Rouse mode amplitude correlation functions and directly related exponent for the monomeric diffusion. We show that the consequences of these results on the dynamics of a tagged monomer and the chain’s segmental orientation autocorrelation function agree very well with rheological measurements and NMR relaxometry experiments. We reflect back on a history of related experimental anomalies and discuss how a new theory might be developed.',\n",

Similar results were obtained on a lower molecular weight PMMA, for which there was less overlap of the two peaks. The implication is that density scaling of the segmental relaxation times originates in the glass transition dynamics, not, as recently suggested, in higher frequency secondary processes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional  perovskite solar cell  can achieve high stability by alternating interface cations. However, its main transmissive charge is limited owing to the 2D structure. Therefore, compared with a 3D device, the 2D PSC has poor power conversion efficiency . Further enhanced performance will require an increase in the transmission dimension of 2D PSC. Here, a novel tetraethylenepent -MAPbI3–xClx analogous 2D unsymmetrical perovskite film was developed to improve the stability and PCE of the corresponding device. Based on the interaction of the active amino linear short chain of TEPA and the halogen ion, the symmetry of the mechanical structure of ions is disrupted, and the TEPA ion is embedded in the perovskite structure to form a perovskite structure with a dimension between 3D and 2D. Noticeably, the TEPA-MAPbI3–xClx devices deliver high PCEs up to 19.73% which stands as the highest for MAPbI3–xClx-based PSC. The environmental, thermal, and illumination stability also showed improvements ranging between 10%–30%. The enhanced PSCs are due to the higher quality of perovskite films, stronger charge transmission, and less trap density. This approach provides a new method to improve and modify 2D PSCs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The synthesis and characterization of novel self-complementary multiple hydrogen-bonded  polymers containing pendant 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone  units are described. SCMHB pendant polymers, poly, were prepared via free radical copolymerization of butyl acrylate  and a novel SCMHB methacrylate  monomer, which was synthesized via a quantitative coupling reaction between 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate  and methyl isocytosine  in DMSO. The glass transition temperatures of poly increased in a linear fashion as the SCMHB MA content increased. Thermogravimetric analysis of the copolymers exhibited an onset of weight loss at 217 °C. Solution viscosity analysis indicated that SCMHB pendant polymers strongly aggregated in nonpolar solvents, such as toluene and CHCl3, and dissociated in polar solvents, such as THF. Based on melt rheological characterization, the melt viscosity of soluble SCMHB pendant polymers was an order of magnitude higher than that of PBA due to strong aggregation in the melt state. SCMHB pendant polymers exhibited thermoreversible characteristics, and complete dissociation in the melt state was observed at 80 °C, which was consistent with our earlier studies involving SCMHB-terminated poly , poly , and PS-b-PI block copolymers. In addition, SCMHB units completely dissociated at 80 °C in toluene on the basis of 1H NMR measurements. The 90° peel strength values for SCMHB-containing polymers increased as the SCMHB units increased due to the strong interaction of SCMHB units with the glass surface. Thin-layer chromatography indicated that the interaction of SCMHB pendant polymers with silica was more favorable compared to PBA homopolymer. ',\n",

Pt−Ni alloyed nanoparticles with approximate diameter 3 nm and with different Pt to Ni molar ratios were deposited on the NCNTs by a microwave-polyol method. Electron microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were deposited homogeneously on the outer surface of the NCNTs and were immobilized at active nitrogen sites. A dielectrophoresis technique was used to selectively align the Pt−Ni-coated NCNTs between metallic electrodes to form conductometric hydrogen gas sensors. Gas sensing measurements performed with different concentrations of hydrogen revealed that the sensor based upon Pt/NCNTs exhibited the fastest response and recovery and best sensitivity. The sensing mechanism in the Pt/NCNT sensors can be explained by a combination of responses from the nitrogen-induced defects and the supported Pt nanoparticles, with the latter providing significantly faster response and recovery.',\n",

The main difference between these methods is in the treatment of particle–particle interactions: by calculating collision forces , using momentum conservation laws , or based on the particle stress model . Here, these methods are compared by simulating the same small-scale fluidized bed with the same open-source code MFIX. The results indicate that both modeling the particle–particle collision by TDHS and lumping a few particles in a parcel increase the computation speed with little loss in accuracy. However, the MP-PIC method predicts an unphysical particle–particle overlap, which results in incorrect overall bed hydrodynamics. These results suggest using the CGHS method for fluidized bed simulations owing to its accuracy and efficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In a series of mono and mixed-alkali borosilicate glasses , , and ), we have applied triple-quantum magic-angle spinning  and 11B and 17O NMR to obtain high-resolution information about short-range structure and the connections among various network structural units, to study the effect of mixed cations on the glass structure, and to explore the distribution and mixing of these modifier cations. For a Li-containing glass, a lower fraction of B, a lower fraction of Si−O−B, and a higher fraction of nonbridging oxygen than those found in Na- and K-containing glasses suggests that there is a significant heterogeneity in terms of Si/B mixing in the former. For Li−Na and Li−K mixed cation glasses, anomalously high fractions of nonbridging oxygen were also observed along with smaller fractions of B and Si−O−B, again indicating significant chemical heterogeneity. For Na−K mixed cation glasses, the populations of boron and oxygen species are similar to the average population of Na- and K-containing glasses, indicating that these glasses are less heterogeneous. Oxygen-17 and boron-11 chemical shift data indicate cation preferences in coordination by nonbridging oxygen, Si−O−Si, B, and B species for Li−Na and Li−K glasses but not for Na−K glass. The result suggests that in the Na−K glass, modifier cations are nearly randomly mixed and the degree of Si/B mixing is similar to that of the Na and K glasses. However, Li−Na and Li−K glasses are likely to contain nanoscale lithium-silicate rich domains embedded in Na/K borosilicate matrixes. ',\n",
