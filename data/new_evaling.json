This is also of interest in rheological studies, industrial screening tests of new formulations, and the real-time interpretation of osmotic compression experiments, for example. For charge-stabilized spherical particles, the osmotic pressure can be computed with standard liquid theories. However, this calculation can sometimes be lengthy and/or unstable under some physicochemical conditions, a drawback that precludes its use in multiscale flow simulators. As a simple, fast, and robust replacement, the literature reports estimations of the osmotic pressure that have been built by adding the Carnahan\u2013Starling and the cell model pressures .

Theoretical complexity arises not only from the long-ranged electrostatic interaction but also from the multicomponent nature of the solution, In this work, we report grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for the effect of added salt on the osmotic pressure of a primitive model of polyelectrolyte solutions. The polymer chains are freely jointed charged hard spheres, and counterions and co-ions are charged hard spheres. We use an ensemble that allows us to calculate directly the osmotic pressure for a solution in equilibrium with a bulk salt solution. As the bulk salt concentration is increased, the concentration of salt in the polyelectrolyte solution decreases and for semidilute solutions the salt concentration is very low. In dilute solution, the salt contribution to the osmotic pressure arises from electrostatic screening and excluded volume interactions. Semidilute solutions behave like salt-free solutions.

The tendency to self-assemble is responsible for appreciable deviations from quasichemical theory even in systems that do not form micellar aggregates but are close to the boundary of macroscopic phase separation.

We established the equation of state of our isolate by osmotic compression and characterized the concentration-induced structural transitions, from the secondary structure of proteins to the rheological properties. We evidenced three thermodynamical regimes corresponding to several structuring regimes. First, for \u03a6 &lt; 0.03, gliadins behave as repulsive colloids, with a positive second virial coefficient, arising presumably from their surface charge density and/or their steric repulsion. No intermolecular interaction was detected by FT-IR, suggesting that proteins form a stable dispersion. In the second regime, the system becomes more easily compressible, i.e., less repulsive and/or more attractive. It is associated with the disappearance of -sheet intramolecular structures of the proteins in favor of random coils/-helix and intermolecular -sheet interactions. This coincides with the appearance of elasticity and the increase of the apparent viscosity. Finally, in the last regime, for \u03a6 &gt; 0.16, FT-IR spectra show that proteins are strongly interacting via intermolecular interactions. A correlation peak develops in SAXS, revealing a global order in the dispersion. Interestingly, the osmotic pressure applied to extract the solvent is higher than expected from a hard-sphere-like protein and we highlighted a liquid-like state at very high concentration  which is in contrast with most proteins that form gel or glass at such concentration.

Thermodynamic forces between DNA helices are measured from the dependence of helical interaxial spacings on the osmotic pressure applied by poly solutions in equilibrium with the DNA phase. The sensitivity of these forces to solute concentration can be transformed into a change in the number of excess or deficit solutes or waters in the DNA phase by applying the Gibbs\u2212Duhem equation. The alcohols examined are excluded from the condensed DNA array and strongly affect the osmotic stress force curves. DNA is preferentially hydrated. MPD is significantly more excluded than 2-propanol. The exclusion of these alcohols, however, is not due to a steric repulsion since glycerol that is intermediate in size between MPD and 2-propanol does not observably affect DNA force curves. As the distance between DNA helices varies, the change in the number of excess waters is independent of alcohol concentration for each alcohol. These solutes are acting osmotically on the condensed array.

The Ca2 ions primarily affect the third-order interaction term, which strongly increases upon the introduction of Ca2 ions. The second-order interaction term only slightly depends on the CaCl2 concentration. It is demonstrated that DNA gels cross-linked in solutions containing CaCl2 exhibit reduced osmotic mixing pressure. The concentration dependence of the shear modulus of DNA gels can be described by a single power law.

A general solution for the molecular weight distribution as a function of conversion has been derived. The solution depends only on the rate constants for propagation, the trapping of the growing chains by nitroxide radical, and the release of the growing chain. The general form of the solution is the same in GTP and the stable free radical-mediated polymerization , except for the definition of the constants. Using the measured and known experimental rate constants for SFRP and fitting to the only unknown rate constant, that for reversible chain termination by the nitroxide radical, allow a quantitative prediction of the molecular weight distribution with conversion for bulk free radical living polymerization of polystyrene. In this way a good fit to the experimental polydispersity is obtained over a wide range of polymerization conditions. The calculated rate for the reversible termination is reasonable compared to known nitroxide-trapping reactions but is over 3 orders of magnitude slower than for a diffusion-controlled reaction, on the same order as the rate constant for polystyrene radical\u2212radical termination. Nevertheless, because of the excess nitroxide present, trapping is fast enough to ensure a high rate of exchange of growing and dormant chains, resulting in narrow polydispersities at high conversion. The very good fit to this model indicates that neither initiation nor termination are important to the conversion dependence of the molecular weight distribution, as neither were taken into account in the kinetic model. This is further support for the current understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of the SFRP process. The polydispersity in the bulk living free radical polymerization mediated by nitroxide is controlled by the exchange rate between the growing and dormant chains. At high conversion where the rate of polymerization is high, there can be some irreversible chain termination and some autopolymerization.

Experiments carried out at varied DTBP concentrations confirmed that DTBP does not interact with the Lewis acid or with carbocations and its role is to scavenge protic impurities. The large difference in the polymerization rate in the presence and absence of proton trap was attributed to the different nature of the true coinitiator, Me2AlCl, in the presence of DTBP and MeAlCl2 , a stronger Lewis acid that could be present as an impurity or may form by the reaction of Me2AlCl with protic impurities , in the absence of DTBP.

Electronic energy transfer  couplings represent a key property in this respect since such couplings provide important insight into the strength of interaction between photoactive pigments in protein\u2013pigment complexes. Recently, attention has been payed to how the environment modifies or even controls the electronic couplings. To enable such theoretical predictions, a fully polarizable embedding model has been suggested . In this work, we further develop this computational model by extending it with an ab initio derived polarizable force field including higher-order multipole moments. We use this extended model to systematically examine three different ways of obtaining EET couplings in a heterogeneous medium ranging from use of the exact transition density to a point-dipole approximation. Several interesting observations are made, for example, the explicit use of transition densities in the calculation of the electronic couplings, and also when including the explicit environment contribution, can be replaced by a much simpler transition point charge description without comprising the quality of the model predictions.", "level1": ["Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry", "Materials science", "Analytical chemistry", "Cross-disciplinary concepts", "Organic chemistry"], "level2": ["Physical and chemical properties", "Dyes and pigments", "Sample preparation", "Materials", "Organic reactions"], "level3": ["Electrical properties", "Embedding", "Polarity", "Dyes and pigments", "Coupling reactions"], "levels": ["Chemical engineering and industrial chemistry", "Materials science", "Analytical chemistry", "Cross-disciplinary concepts", "Organic chemistry", "Physical and chemical properties", "Dyes and pigments", "Sample preparation", "Materials", "Organic reactions", "Electrical properties", "Embedding", "Polarity", "Dyes and pigments", "Coupling reactions"]}, {"title": "Preparation of Protein\u2212Silicate Hybrids from Polyamine Intercalation of Layered Montmorillonite", "abstract": "Hybrids of the model BSA protein and layered silicate clay with d spacing of \u223c62 \u00c5 were prepared from either direct or stepwise intercalation.

Like the Word2vec models, where vectors of closely related words are in close proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec learns vector representations of molecular substructures that point in similar directions for chemically related substructures. Compounds can finally be encoded as vectors by summing the vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, be fed into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound properties. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning approach on a so-called corpus of compounds that consists of all available chemical matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pretrained once, yields dense vector representations, and overcomes drawbacks of common compound feature representations such as sparseness and bit collisions. The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on several compound property and bioactivity data sets and compared with results obtained for Morgan fingerprints as a reference compound representation. Mol2vec can be easily combined with ProtVec, which employs the same Word2vec concept on protein sequences, resulting in a proteochemometric approach that is alignment-independent and thus can also be easily used for proteins with low sequence similarities.", "level1": ["Analytical chemistry", "Physical chemistry", "Theoretical and computational chemistry", "Biology and biological chemistry"], "level2": ["Molecular modeling", "Sample preparation", "Molecules", "Biochemistry"], "level3": ["Embedding", "Peptides and proteins"], "levels": ["Analytical chemistry", "Physical chemistry", "Theoretical and computational chemistry", "Biology and biological chemistry", "Molecular modeling", "Sample preparation", "Molecules", "Biochemistry", "Embedding", "Peptides and proteins"]}, {"title": "A Geodesic Framework for Analyzing Molecular Similarities", "abstract": "A fast self-organizing algorithm for extracting the minimum number of independent variables that can fully describe a set of observations was recently described .

Its success depends critically on the choice of the neighborhood radius, which should be consistent with the local curvature of the underlying manifold. Here, we describe a procedure for determining that radius by examining the tradeoff between the stress function and the number of connected components in the neighborhood graph and show that it can be used to produce meaningful maps in any embedding dimension.
