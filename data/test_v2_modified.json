A promising alternative to the commonly used CdS buffer layer in thin film solar cells that contain absorbers with lower electron affinity can be found in -In2S3.

The ability of par3 PDZ domains to target various adhesion molecules and enzymes at the plasma membrane leads to the controlled localization of par6 and aPKC, which has firmly established its role in epithelial cell polarity. Of the numerous PDZ ligands associated with par3, interaction of its third PDZ domain with the class II ligand found within the C-terminal tail of vascular endothelial cadherin  suggests a role in endothelial cell polarity as well, but the molecular details of the interaction are unknown. Previously determined structures of par3-PDZ3 bound to the class I ligand found within the C-terminal tail of the phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN revealed two discrete binding sites: a canonical PDZ\u2212ligand interaction site and a distal site involving charge\u2212charge complements. Currently, it is unclear if par3-PDZ3 employs both canonical and distal binding modes in its association with VE-Cad or if these modes are unique to the PTEN interaction, suggesting a possible mechanism for ligand specificity within the polarity network. The structure of par3-PDZ3 bound to the C-terminal tail of VE-Cad presented in this work shows that both canonical and distal interactions are utilized in binding. Biophysical measurements using fluorescence polarization and two-dimensional NMR implicate the intermolecular charge pairing of aspartic acid 777  and arginine 609  as a crucial modulator of complex formation.

They undergo dynamic rupture and rebonding processes on the time scale of tens of picoseconds. Proteins can partially rearrange during such ruptures. In previous work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of these fluctuating hydrogen bonds. This indicated long-range entropy and energy contributions extending far into the liquid environment. The results showed that the binding of a given hydrogen bond is much reduced as a result of these interactions in water, as is required for biological activity and in very good confirmation of known experimental results. The larger water environment directly interacts with the hydrogen bond essentially due to long-range molecular interactions. Such a substantial lowering of the energy of the hydrogen bond in water brings it into the range of activation by many biological processes . Thus, the water medium profoundly increases the rate. Furthermore, very large entropic changes are associated with the rupture of hydrogen bonds in water, whereas no such effects are seen for the isolated molecule. Interestingly, such an increase in rates in water is still accompanied by a large negative change in entropy in the extended solvent environment, and this reduces the rate by some 2 orders of magnitude. Recent molecular dynamics experiments in D2O substantiate this model and show a large solvent isotope effect. In this work, we used lipids as the environment for the hydrogen bond and discovered that the energy is also reduced from that found in the isolated molecule, but not as far as in water. On the other hand, we found that no entropy penalty exists for breaking the hydrogen bond in lipids, as seen for water. These two effects compensate, even though the energy is some 2 times larger. The entropic penalty is reduced such that the rate is higher than in water despite the higher energy. This is a significant result for understanding the reactivity and dynamics of proteins in lipids. It should be noted that these are very important solvent effects on entropies and free energies that are not usually reflected in statistical thermodynamic computations for reactants and products. The very long-range effect of the solvent makes substantial contributions to kinetic rate constants and is readily evaluated in this kinetic method. To ignore these long-range environmental effects on the entropy can lead to very spurious results when calculating rates of protein mobilities.

Different polymers with biomedical relevance were assessed for the ability to bind to the MOF surface.

FT-IR spectroscopy was used to monitor this reaction in DMSO and also to monitor the reactivity of CORM-2 and of the monomeric DMSO-ligated derivatives in mouse serum. While the CORM-2 dimer readily liberates CO in mouse serum under ambient conditions, the monomeric Ru subunits formed in DMSO solution do not. This demonstrates that a substantial fraction of the CO-delivery agent being introduced via DMSO solutions would appear to be, in fact, inactive. Photochemical irradiation readily liberates CO from the inactive species, and thus a combined thermal\u2013photochemical approach can greatly improve the yield of CO delivery. Ultrafast experiments indicate that CO loss from the DMSO-ligated monomers is a primary photochemical process.

In both processes the decay of the peroxyl radical leads predominantly to the formation of 4-oxo-CHA, and minor amounts of hydroxy-CHA .

Previously, a limited number of inhibitors have shown efficacy in combating such bacterial drug resistance. However, many Gram-negative pathogens have evolved inhibitor resistant forms of these hydrolytic enzymes. A single point mutation of the active site residue Ser130 to a Gly in either TEM or SHV results in resistance to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, an important clinical -lactam\u2212-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic. Previous structural and modeling studies of the S130G mutants of TEM and SHV have shown differences in how these two distinct but closely related enzymes compensate for the loss of the Ser130 residue. In the case of S130G SHV, a structure of tazobactam in the active site has suggested that the inhibitor preferentially assumes a cis-enamine intermediate form when the Ser130 hydroxyl is absent. Raman crystallographic studies of S130G SHV inhibited with tazobactam, sulbactam, clavulanic acid, and 2-glutaroxy penem sulfone  were performed with the aim of identifying the type and amount of intermediate formed with each drug to understand the role of the S130G mutation in formation of the important enamine intermediates. It is demonstrated that with the exception of sulbactam, each compound forms observable trans-enamine intermediates. For S130G reacted with tazobactam, identical steady state levels of enamine are achieved when compared to those of wild-type  or even deacylation deficient forms of the enzyme. With clavulanic acid, slightly smaller amounts of enamine are observed within the first 30 min of the reaction but are not significantly different than those for tazobactam. Thus, the resistance mutation does not substantially affect the amount of trans-enamine formed with clavulanic acid during the critical early time period of inhibition. This finding has important implications in the design of -lactamase inhibitors for drug resistant variants like S130G SHV.

Although this system has been reported to be entirely miscible, the DSC results revealed that the glass transition temperatures of the blends were not composition-dependent in the whole composition range. Furthermore, these transitions were quite broad or even double in the blends with high CP content. These features are the result of differing molecular motions attributed to the difference in chemical structure between the two components of the blend. The feasible maximum draw ratio decreased with increasing CP content due to restraint of chain slippage and necking caused by the stiffness and high friction coefficient of the CP component. A remarkable feature during uniaxial drawing was that the manner of crystallization of the PHB component under strain varied from the c-axis-oriented to the a-axis-oriented crystal growth with increasing CP content. WAXD analysis demonstrated that drawn pure PHB exhibited an ordinary c-axis-oriented pattern, indicating that the  and  main reflections of PHB were concentrated on the equatorial line.

This study demonstrates that conformational changes in pectin may play a more important role than pectin depolymerization in the irreversible loss of serum viscosity during industrial tomato paste production. Samples of tomato juice, processing intermediates, and paste were obtained from a commercial producer in California. After dilution to 5 \u00b0Brix, tomato serum was obtained by centrifugation at 15000g for 10 min. Weight average molecular weight  and root-mean-square  radius of the polymers in the tomato serum were determined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering and refractive index detectors . Serum viscosity decreased throughout the juice concentration process, especially at later stages, where the processing temperature reached a maximum of 90\u221295 \u00b0C. In parallel with this decrease in serum viscosity, there was an increase in the soluble pectin concentration. Analysis of the Mw distribution of the tomato serum showed that solubilization of pectin occurred across the entire polymer distribution range. The Mw changed from 2.62 \u00d7 105 g/mol in the juice to 2.61 \u00d7 105 g/mol in the paste, indicating that minimal depolymerization occurred. However, the rms radius distribution indicated that the pectin conformation became more compact as the juice became more concentrated. Conformational plots revealed that serum pectins in the hot-break tomato juice and at the early stages of concentration behaved as extended coils, having shape factors of about 0.40. In processing intermediates taken from later stages in the process and in the paste, the shape factor changed to about 0.25, indicating a more compact conformation. This conformational change correlated with the observed decrease in serum viscosity in the paste production process.

The trends observed with multilayers directly follow from the properties of PECs in solution. Effects of a number of parameters, such as the type of interacting polyelectrolyte chains, the ratio of their lengths, and ionic strength and pH of deposition solutions, on the likelihood of the multilayer stability or erosion are considered. Polycations with high density of primary amino groups and polyanions with SO3- or SO4- groups show the strongest interpolyelectrolyte binding, resulting in inhibited chain exchange within PECs and/or PEMs. With weakly bound polyelectrolyte pairspolycations containing quaternary ammonium groups and carboxylate polyanionswater-soluble PECs are easily formed, often resulting in erosion of PEMs. For the latter case, we report a full phase diagram of polycation/polyanion/NaCl aqueous mixtures and show how ionic strength can be used to tune the deposition of PEMs at surfaces. In addition, we present that the phase behavior of PECs in solution also controls pH response of PEMs at surfaces. Better knowledge of the relationships between the PEMs and PECs allows rational prediction and control of deposition of a wide range of weak or permanently charged polyelectrolytes at surfaces.

This acrylodan-labeled cholesterol oxidase was used to explore the pH, ionic strength, and headgroup dependence of binding. Between pH 6 and 10, there was no significant change in binding affinity. Incorporation of anionic lipids  into the vesicles did not increase the binding affinity nor did altering the ionic strength.

Ethylene causes rapid reoxidation of these CrII sites to CrIII, even at low temperatures. Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopies reveal that the resulting sites contain a vinyl ligand, described as 2CrIII\u2013CH\u2550CH2 although likely with a higher coordination number, which are capable of initiating polymerization. The formation of these vinyl sites is an incommensurate redox reaction involving one-electron oxidation of CrII via ethylene disproportionation. The accompanying formation of organic radical intermediates and their characteristic reaction products suggest that the key step is homolysis of a Cr\u2013ethyl bond.

In particular, it is unknown why hydrated lime putty behaves as an irreversible colloid once dried. Such effect dramatically affects the reactivity and rheology of hydrated lime dispersions. Here we show that the irreversible colloidal behavior of Ca2 dispersions is the result of an oriented aggregation mechanism triggered by drying. Kinetic stability and particle size distribution analysis of oven-dried slaked lime or commercial dry hydrate dispersions exhibit a significant increase in settling speed and particle  size in comparison to slaked lime putty that has never been dried. Drying-related particle aggregation also leads to a significant reduction in surface area. Electron microscopy analyses show porous, randomly oriented, micron-sized clusters that are dominant in the dspersions both before and after drying. However, oriented aggregation of the primary Ca2 nanocrystals  is also observed. Oriented aggregation occurs both before and during drying, and although limited before drying, it is extensive during drying.

The transient IR data reveal the occurrence of an efficient alkyne to allene isomerization of the spacer with a time constant increasing from a few hundreds of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds with solvent viscosity. This process is faster than the vibrational cooling of the Franck\u2013Condon excited state, indicative of nonequilibrium dynamics. The transient electronic absorption and fluorescence data evidence that this transformation is accompanied by a charge separation between the donor and the acceptor subunits. The allene character of the spacer implies an orthogonal orientation of the donor and acceptor moieties, similar to that proposed for twisted intramolecular charge-transfer states. Such states are often invoked in the excited-state dynamics of donor\u2013acceptor dyads, but their involvement could never be unambiguously evidenced spectroscopically. The alkyne\u2013allene isomerization involves not only a torsional motion but also a bending of the molecule due to the sp to sp2 rehybridization of one of the alkyne carbon atoms. This twisted and rehybridized intramolecular charge transfer  state decays back to the planar and linear alkyne ground state on a time scale decreasing from a few hundred to ten picoseconds upon going from weakly to highly polar solvents.

However, disulfide bonds are formed between Shaker subunits in intact cells exposed to oxidizing conditions. Upon electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, intersubunit disulfide bond formation was detected by the presence of four high molecular weight adducts of Shaker protein. This result suggests that intracellular cysteine residues are in sufficiently close proximity in the native structure of the Shaker channel to form intersubunit disulfide bonds. To test this hypothesis, wild-type and mutant Shaker proteins were exposed to oxidizing conditions in intact cells. Intersubunit disulfide bond formation was eliminated upon serine substitution of either C96 in the amino terminal or C505 in the carboxyl terminal of the protein. In contrast, disulfide bond formation was not eliminated upon serine substitution of both C301 and C308 in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments S2 and S3.

PSMA has high affinity for DUPA, a glutamate urea ligand. Herein, a novel DUPA\u2013PTX conjugate is developed using DUPA as the targeting ligand to deliver PTX specifically for treatment of PSMA expressing PCa. The targeting ligand DUPA enhances the transport capability and selectivity of PTX to tumor cells via PSMA mediated endocytosis. Besides, DUPA is conjugated with PTX via a disulfide bond, which facilitates the rapid and differential drug release in tumor cells. The DUPA\u2013PTX conjugate exhibits potent cytotoxicity in PSMA expressing cell lines and induces a complete cessation of tumor growth with no obvious toxicity.

Although the mechanism of homogeneous esterification has long been known, the mechanistic pathways for esterification over heterogeneous catalysts are still being pursued. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the mechanism of gas-phase esterification in the temperature range of 90\u2212140 \u00b0C for a simple carboxylic acid  and short-chain alcohols  that have been catalyzed by a solid catalyst with only Br\u00f8nsted acid sites . In this study, evidence from pyridine poisoning experiments suggests that the esterification proceeds via a single site mechanism on solid Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysts such as SAC-13, as has also been concluded for reaction in the liquid phase at temperatures of \u226460 \u00b0C. Based on initial rate data for methanol reaction, the order of reaction for acetic acid shifted only from 0.7 to 0.9 as the temperature changed from 90 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C. However, the order of reaction for methanol shifted from 0.2 to \u22120.9 for the same temperature range. The results for the ethanol reaction were similar. Based on these outcomes, the reaction most probably happens between adsorbed acetic acid molecules on the active sites of the catalyst and alcohol molecules from the bulk fluid. However, as the temperature increases from 90 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C, the rate-limiting step becomes acetic acid adsorption. The reaction is also hindered by the competitive adsorption of the alcohol on the acid sites of the catalyst. Experiments that involve the preadsorption of reactants offered further evidence of the inhibiting effect of the alcohol and the change in the rate-controlling step for reaction at temperatures of &gt;100 \u00b0C.

It is found that TiO2 on fused silica is first formed as single-crystalline nuclei during an initial heterogeneous nucleation. These TiO2 crystallites elongate along the  direction with their  axis perpendicular to the glass substrate; the elongated nuclei later grew into a round flowerlike morphology owing to a significant increase in homogeneous nucleation rate during the continued growth.

The kinetically sputtered F ion from the metal surface undergoes efficient resonant neutralization due to the band effect. The probability for potential sputtering of F from the F/TiC surface is dependent upon the primary ion species on the order of He &gt; Ne \u226b Ar.

The comparison between H and D irradiations clearly shows that the swifter ion leads to a higher F emission probability.
